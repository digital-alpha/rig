Within three (3) days after execution of this Agreement, Employee shall</br>receive a one-time grant of Thirty Million (30,000,000) shares of Company restricted Common</br>Stock.

Additionally, the Board of Directors shall</br>periodically reView Employee’s Salary to determine whether to otherwise increase Employee’s</br>compensation, without any obligation by the Board to authorize such an increase.</br></br>(6)</br>Participation in Employee Benefit Plans. Employee shall have the same rights, privileges,</br>benefits and opportunities to participate in any the Company’s employee benefit plans which</br>may now or hereafter be in effect on a general basis for executive officers or employees.
