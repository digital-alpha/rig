In the event of the termination of Executive’s employment due to</br>Executive’s Disability, the Company will pay Executive three months of Executive’s Base</br>Salary in a lump sum.”</br></br>4.	 	Section 5(d) of the Agreement is hereby replaced in its entirety by the following:</br></br>“(d) Death. In the event of the termination of Executive’s employment due to</br>Executive’s death, the Company will pay six months of Executive’s Base Salary to Executive’s</br>estate in a lump sum.”</br></br>5.	 	In the first sentence of Section 5(e) of the Agreement, the following text is hereby deleted: “in</br>connection with a Change in Control pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof or”.</br></br>6.	 	Section 5(e)(i) of the Agreement is hereby replaced in its entirety by the following:</br></br>“(i) the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum equal to the Executive’s Base Salary</br>that would be payable in respect of the Post-Termination Period (as defined in Section</br>5(i)).”</br></br>7.	 	Section 5(e)(ii) of the Agreement is hereby replaced in its entirety by the following:</br></br>“(ii) the Company shall pay Executive (A) if the termination of Executive’s employment is</br>prior to a Change in Control, a lump sum at the time the Company ordinarily pays annual</br>bonuses for the year in which the termination occurs equal to the product of (1) Executive’s</br>annual bonus that he would have received in the calendar year in which the Date of</br>Termination occurs based on the Company’s actual performance for such year, and (2) a</br>fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed in the calendar year in which</br>the Date of Termination occurs and the denominator of which is 365; and (B) if the</br>termination of Executive’s employment is on or after a Change in Control, a lump sum upon</br>Executive’s termination of employment equal to Executive’s “Pro Rata Bonus” (as defined in</br>Section 5(i)) for the Post-Termination Period.”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>8.	 	Section 5 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding a new Section 5(k) as follows:</br></br>“(k) Timing of Payments. The lump sum payments in Section 5(c), (d), (e)</br>(except for Section 5(e)(ii)(A)) and (f) will be made by the Company within 15 days</br>following the date of Executive’s termination of employment.”</br></br>9.	 	The following paragraph shall be added as the new Section 13 of the Agreement as follows:</br></br>“13. Section 409A. It is the parties’ intent that the Agreement comply with or be</br>exempt from the requirements of Section 409A and that the Agreement be administered and</br>interpreted accordingly. Each payment made under this Agreement shall be deemed to be</br>separate payments. Amounts payable under this Agreement shall be deemed not to be a</br>“deferral of compensation” subject to Section 409A to the extent provided in the exceptions</br>in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(b)(4) (“short-term deferrals”) and (b)(9)</br>(“separation pay plans,” including the exception under subparagraph (iii)) and other</br>applicable provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1 through A-6. Notwithstanding</br>the previous sentence, if and to the extent that any payment or benefit under this Agreement</br>is determined by the Company to constitute “non-qualified deferred compensation” subject to</br>Section 409A and is payable to Executive by reason of Executive’s termination of employment,</br>then (a) such payment or benefit shall be made or provided to Executive only upon a</br>“separation from service” as defined for purposes of Section 409A under applicable</br>regulations and (b) if Executive is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section</br>409A and as determined by the Company), such payment or benefit shall be made or provided on</br>the date that is six months and one day after the date of Executive’s separation from</br>service (or earlier death). Any amount not paid in respect of the six month period</br>specified in the preceding sentence will be paid to Executive (plus interest at the</br>applicable federal rate as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code)</br>in a lump sum on the date that is six months and one day after the Executive’s separation</br>from service (or earlier death). Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to the</br>extent any expense reimbursement or other in-kind benefit is determined to be subject to</br>Section 409A, the amount of any such expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits</br>in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind</br>benefits in any other taxable year (except under any lifetime limit applicable to expenses</br>for medical care), in no event shall any expenses be reimbursed or in-kind benefits be</br>provided after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which</br>Executive incurred such expenses or received such benefits, and in no event shall any right</br>to reimbursement or in-kind benefits be subject to liquidation or exchange for another</br>benefit.”</br></br>10.	 	The definition of Good Reason in Schedule B to the Agreement is hereby replaced in its entirety</br>by the following:</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>“Good Reason” will mean, without Executive’s express written consent:</br></br>(A)	 	Executive’s being removed, or not being re-elected, as a director, or as</br>Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Company, or as a director or as Chairman of the</br>Board of the Bank, except in connection with termination of Executive’s employment by</br>the Company for Cause or Disability or by Executive without Good Reason or due to</br>death;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>(B)	 	Any change in the duties or responsibilities (including reporting</br>responsibilities) of Executive that is inconsistent in any material and adverse respect</br>with Executive’s positions(s), duties, responsibilities or status with the Company</br>(including any material and adverse diminution of such duties or responsibilities) or</br>(ii) a material and adverse change in Executive’s titles or offices (including, if</br>applicable, membership on the Board) with the Company or its affiliates;</br></br>(C)	 	A material reduction by the Company in either (1) the aggregate of Executive’s</br>Base Salary and Bonus opportunity (including any material and adverse change in the</br>formula for such Bonus opportunity) or (2) the aggregate of Executive’s Base Salary and</br>Bonus, in either case of (1) or (2), as in effect immediately prior to a Change in</br>Control or as the same may be increased from time to time thereafter;</br></br>(D)	 	Assignment to Executive of any duties or withdrawal from Executive of any</br>authority or change in Executive’s conditions of employment materially inconsistent</br>with Sections 2 or 3 hereof;</br></br>(E)	 	The Company’s requiring Executive to maintain Executive’s principal office or</br>conduct Executive’s principal activities anywhere other than at the Company’s principal</br>executive offices in New York City (other than an immaterial change in the geographic</br>location); or</br></br>(F)	 	Any other action or inaction by the Company that constitutes a material breach</br>of this Agreement;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>provided that, a termination by Executive with Good Reason shall be effective only if,</br>(1) within 90 days following Executive becoming aware of the circumstances giving rise to</br>Good Reason, Executive delivers a Notice of Termination for Good Reason to the Company,</br>(2) the Company within 30 days following its receipt of such notification has failed to cure</br>the circumstances giving rise to Good Reason, and (3) Executive terminates Executive’s</br>employment with the Company within 90 days after the lapse of such 30 day cure period.”</br></br></br></br></br>11.	 	This Amendment constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the</br>subject matter hereof and shall not be altered or amended except in a writing signed by the</br>parties whose rights or obligations are affected by such amendment or alteration. Except as</br>expressly stated herein, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</br></br></br></br></br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Amendment effective as of as of the first date</br>written above.</br></br></br></br></br></br>STERLING BANCORP</br></br></br>By:</br></br>Name:</br></br>Title:</br></br></br></br>Dale C.
