To the extent permitted by California law, you agree to indemnify and hold Spectral harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising</br>from or attributable to or resulting from your gross negligence or willful misconduct in rendering the services. You warrant and represent that you have full power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and that your performance of</br>this Agreement will not violate the provisions of any other agreement to which you are a party. Spectral agrees to indemnify and hold you harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, losses, damages, liability, costs and</br>expenses, including attorneys fees arising out of your services hereunder, other than those arising from or attributable to or resulting from your gross negligence or willful misconduct. Spectral will name you as an officer on any policy of</br>directors and officers liability insurance it secures throughout the term of your employment.</br></br>7. Termination. This Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder shall, under any of the following circumstances, terminate in advance of the time specified in Section 2 above, and you shall</br>have the right to receive only your compensation that shall be accrued hereunder through the effective date of such termination and shall have no right to receive any further compensation hereunder from and after the time of such termination:</br></br></br>7.1 Death. This Agreement and</br>your duties hereunder shall terminate immediately upon your death.</br></br>7.2 Termination by Spectral. In the event that you shall become either physically or mentally incapacitated so as to be incapable of performing your duties as required hereunder, and if such incapacity</br>shall continue for a period of 40 consecutive days, Spectral may, at its option, terminate this Agreement and your duties hereunder by written notice to you at that time or at any time thereafter while such incapacity continues. Spectral may</br>terminate this Agreement for Cause (as hereinafter defined) at any time upon written notice to you. “Cause” as used in this Agreement means that you, (i) after reasonable notice and warning, have failed to perform your assigned duties</br>to Spectral as determined by the Board of Directors, (ii) have materially breached any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement and have failed to correct such breach within 15 days following written notice from Spectral of such breach, or</br>(iii)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Mr.

You may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to Spectral if Spectral shall have materially breached any of the provisions of this Agreement and has failed to correct such breach within 15 days following written</br>notice from you of such breach.</br></br>8. Arbitration.</br>In the event of any dispute under this Agreement, such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration with JAMS/ENDISPUTE in Los Angeles, California. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge with at least five years of experience on the bench. This</br>provision shall not be interpreted so as to require arbitration of claims that the state and/or Federal Courts of California have ruled may not be the subjects of compelled arbitration in employment matters, nor shall it be interpreted so as to</br>restrict any remedy, right of appeal or discovery device available to either party in a manner that violates the rulings of the state and/or Federal Courts of California with respect to employment-related arbitration. This provision shall not be</br>interpreted so as to preclude the making of reports to governmental offices, or to preclude either party from seeking injunctive or provisional relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction under such circumstances as may merit such relief. This</br>arbitration provision is inapplicable to claims of less than $25,000.</br></br>9. Confidentiality. While this Agreement is in effect and for a period of five years thereafter, you shall hold and keep secret and confidential all “trade secrets” (within the meaning of California law) and shall</br>use such information only in the course of performing your duties hereunder; provided, however, that with respect to trade secrets, you shall hold and keep secret and confidential such trade secrets for so long as they remain trade secrets under</br>California law. You shall maintain in trust all such trade secrets as the Company’s property, including, but not limited to, all documents concerning the Company’s business, including your work papers, telephone directories, customer</br>information and notes, and any and all copies thereof in your possession or under your control. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of your employment with the Company, or upon request by the Company, you shall deliver to the Company all such</br>documents belonging to the Company, including any and all copies in your possession or under your control.</br></br>10. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California as the joint work product of</br>the parties with advice of counsel and shall not be interpreted in favor of either party based on the identity of the drafter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Mr.
