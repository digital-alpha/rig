Any Bonus awarded under this Agreement to Executive</br>shall be determined as follows: (i) 70% of the Bonus (the "EBITDA Bonus Award")</br>shall be based upon the achievement of the Target EBITDA (as defined below) for</br>such year and (ii) 30% of the Bonus (the "Discretionary Bonus Award") shall be</br>awarded on the basis of other criteria, as determined by the Compensation</br>Committee, in its sole discretion.</br></br>For purposes of determining Executive's Bonus, "Target" shall</br>mean (i) with respect to the EBITDA Bonus Award, achievement of the annual</br>target earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the</br>Company ("Target EBITDA") established by the Compensation Committee in its sole</br>discretion, and (ii) with respect to the Discretionary Bonus Award, achievement</br>of other criteria as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole</br>discretion.

In the event of a Change in</br>Control (as defined below) while Executive is still employed by the Company,</br>all options granted to Executive under the 2003 Equity Plan or otherwise and</br>then held by Executive shall become fully vested. For purposes of this</br>Agreement, a Change in Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the</br>following: (i) the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into another</br>corporation or sells, assigns, conveys, transfers, leases or otherwise disposes</br>of all or substantially all of its assets to any person, or any corporation</br>consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in any such event</br>pursuant to a transaction in which the outstanding voting</br></br></br></br><PAGE></br></br>stock of the Company is changed into or exchanged for cash, securities or other</br>property, other than any such transaction where (A) the outstanding voting</br>stock of the Company is changed into or exchanged for (x) voting stock of the</br>surviving or transferee corporation or (y) cash, securities (whether or not</br>including voting stock) or other property, and (B) all or any holders of the</br>voting stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction own, directly</br>or indirectly, in the aggregate not less than 50% of the voting power of the</br>voting stock of the surviving corporation immediately after such transaction or</br>(ii) the Company is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation;</br>provided, however, that a Change in Control shall not include any going private</br>or leveraged buy-out transaction which is sponsored by Executive or in which</br>Executive acquires an equity interest materially in excess of his equity</br>interest in the Company immediately prior to such transaction (the events</br>described in (i) or (ii) above being referred to herein as a "Change in</br>Control").</br></br>8.     Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition.</br></br>a.      During the Term and thereafter, Executive shall not,</br>except as may be required to perform his duties hereunder or as required by</br>applicable law, disclose to others or use, whether directly or indirectly, any</br>Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential</br>Information" shall mean information about the Company, its subsidiaries and</br>affiliates, and their respective clients, customers and employees that is not</br>available to the general public and that was learned by Executive in the course</br>of his employment by the Company, including (without limitation) any</br>proprietary knowledge, trade secrets, data, formulae, information, client and</br>customer lists, information regarding other employees of the Company, and all</br>papers, resumes, records (including computer records) and the documents</br>containing such Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that such</br>Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature and of great value to</br>the Company, and that such information gives the Company a competitive</br>advantage. Upon the termination of his employment for any reason whatsoever,</br>Executive shall promptly deliver to the Company all documents, computer tapes</br>and disks (and all copies thereof) containing any Confidential Information.</br></br>b.      During the Term and for two (2) years thereafter,</br>Executive shall not, directly or indirectly in any manner or capacity (e.g., as</br>an advisor, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, shareholder,</br>employee, member of any association or otherwise) engage in, work for, consult,</br>provide advice or assistance or otherwise participate in any activity that</br>competes with the Company in the business of temporary staffing, direct</br>placement, managed staffing services or IT consulting in any of the following</br>jurisdictions (it being agreed that the Company maintains business operations</br>in each of such jurisdictions): Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, the</br>District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts,</br>Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon,</br>Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and</br>Washington. Executive further agrees that during such period he will not assist</br>or encourage any other person in carrying out any activity that would be</br>prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 8 if such activity</br>were carried out by Executive and, in particular, Executive agrees that he will</br>not induce any employee of the Company to carry out any such activity;</br>provided, however, that the "beneficial ownership" by Executive, either</br>individually or as a member of a "group," as such</br></br></br></br></br></br><PAGE></br></br>terms are used in Rule 13d of the General Rules and Regulations under the</br>Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of less than 2% of the voting</br>stock of any publicly held corporation shall not be a violation of this</br>Agreement. It is further expressly agreed that the Company will or would suffer</br>irreparable injury if Executive were to compete with the Company or any</br>subsidiary or affiliate of the Company in violation of this Agreement and that</br>the Company would by reason of such competition be entitled to injunctive</br>relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and Executive further consents</br>and stipulates to the entry of such injunctive relief in such a court</br>prohibiting Executive from competing with the Company or any subsidiary or</br>affiliate of the Company in violation of this Agreement.</br></br>c.     During the Term and for two (2) years thereafter,</br>Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, influence or attempt to influence</br>customers or suppliers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates,</br>to divert their business to any competitor of the Company.</br></br>d.     Executive recognizes that he will possess confidential</br>information about other employees of the Company relating to their education,</br>experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, and interpersonal</br>relationships with customers of the Company. Executive recognizes that the</br>information he will possess about these other employees is not generally known,</br>is of substantial value to the Company in developing its business and in</br>securing and retaining customers, and will be acquired by him because of his</br>business position with the Company. Executive agrees that, during the Term, and</br>for a period of two (2) years thereafter, he will not, directly or indirectly,</br>solicit or recruit any employee of the Company for the purpose of being</br>employed by his or by any competitor of the Company on whose behalf he is</br>acting as an agent, representative or employee.</br></br>e.      Executive acknowledges that he was informed of the time,</br>territory, scope and other essential requirements of the restrictions in this</br>Paragraph 8 when he agreed to become employed with the Company under the terms</br>set forth in this Agreement, and Executive further acknowledges that he has</br>received sufficient and valuable consideration for his agreement to such</br>restrictions.</br></br>9.     Waiver. The failure of a party to enforce any term, provision,</br>or condition of this Agreement at any time or times shall not be deemed a</br>waiver of that term, provision, or condition for the future, nor shall any</br>specific waiver of a term, provision, or condition at one time be deemed a</br>waiver of such term, provision, or condition for any future time or times.</br></br>10.    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; No Jury Trial. This Agreement shall</br>be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North</br>Carolina without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. Each party</br>hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts</br>sitting in Mecklenburg County, State of North Carolina, for the adjudication of</br>any dispute hereunder (except as hereinafter provided). EACH PARTY HEREBY</br>IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY</br>FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS</br>AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OR</br>AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,</br>THAT SUCH</br></br></br></br></br><PAGE></br></br>OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE</br>FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE</br>IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,</br>AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG</br>OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS SECTION. If, for any reason, the</br>foregoing jury trial waiver is not enforceable at the time of any dispute</br>hereunder, then such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration in</br>accordance with the then current National Rules for the Resolution of</br>Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association. Such arbitration,</br>if necessary, shall be convened in the City of Charlotte, State of North</br>Carolina. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company shall be</br>entitled to seek a restraining order or injunction in any court of competent</br>jurisdiction to prevent any continuation of any violation of the provisions of</br>Paragraph 8 of this Agreement, and Executive consents that such restraining</br>order or injunction may be granted without the necessity of the Company's</br>posting any bond, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law.</br></br>11.    Tax Withholding. The Company shall withhold from any amounts</br>payable under this Agreement such federal, state and local income and</br>employment taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable</br>law or regulation.</br></br>12.    Paragraph Headings. Paragraph headings contained in this</br>Agreement are for reference purposes only and are in no way intended to</br>describe, interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this</br>Agreement or any provision hereof.</br></br>13.    Severability. Each provision of this Agreement is intended to be</br>severable. If any provision of this Agreement or any portion thereof is</br>declared invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any court of</br>competent jurisdiction, the remainder of such provisions and all of the</br>remaining provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</br></br>14.    Integrated Agreement, Amendments. Except for stock option</br>agreements and the terms of the 2003 Equity Plan, this Agreement constitutes</br>the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect</br>to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements,</br>understandings, memoranda, term sheets, conversations and negotiations,</br>including without limitation the Employment Agreement between the Company and</br>Executive dated January 19, 1998. This Agreement can only be changed or</br>modified pursuant to a written instrument duly executed by each of the parties</br>hereto.</br></br>15.    Interpretation, Counterparts. No provision of this Agreement is</br>to be interpreted for or against any party because that party drafted such</br>provision. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each</br>of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and</br>the same instrument.</br></br>16.    Assignment. The Company may assign this Agreement to any direct</br>or indirect subsidiary or parent of the Company or joint venture in which the</br>Company has an interest, or any successor (whether by merger, consolidation,</br>purchase or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the stock, assets or</br>business of the Company and this Agreement shall be binding upon and</br></br></br></br><PAGE></br></br>inure to the benefit of such successors and assigns. Executive may not sell,</br>transfer, assign, or pledge any of his rights or interests pursuant to this</br>Agreement.</br></br>17.    Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be</br>in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by hand</br>delivery, or by facsimile (with confirmation of transmission), or by overnight</br>courier, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage</br>prepaid, in each case addressed as follows:</br></br></br>If to Executive:</br></br>
