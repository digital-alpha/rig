Your 1999\nperformance bonus target percentage will be 35% of the base salary actually paid\nto you by Excite in 1999; payment of your bonus and the ultimate percentage of\npaid base salary used to calculate the bonus will be based upon achievement of\ncompany, department and individual goals.\n\nIn addition to your salary and any bonuses, Excite's management will recommend\nthat the Compensation Committee of Excite's Board of Directors approve an\nemployee stock option grant of 250,000 shares of Excite's Common Stock. The\nCompensation Committee will set the exercise price of the options at fair market\nvalue, as determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of the grant. The\noptions will be subject to vesting at a rate of one-forty eighth (1/48) of the\nfull amount of the grant for each full succeeding month of your employment over\na period of four years. However, the recommended option grant described in this\nletter is not a promise of compensation nor is it intended to create any\nobligation on the part of Excite. Further details on Excite's Option Plan and\nany specific grant to you will be provided upon approval of such grant by the\nCompensation Committee.\n\nIn addition, as long as you remain a full-time employee of the company, Excite\nwill provide you with a $1,000,000 loan, at the lowest prevailing applicable\nfederal rate provided by the Internal Revenue Service at the time of the loan,\nwhich you can exercise at your discretion during your term of employment with\nExcite. If you elect to exercise this loan, you must give Excite thirty (30)\ndays written notice. Your stock options will serve as collateral for the loan.\nUnless repaid earlier by you as described below, the principal amount will be\ndue and payable as follows: (i) if you elect to end your employment with Excite\nfor any reason and any amount of the principal remains unpaid at the conclusion\nof your employment with Excite, you will immediately repay the unpaid loan\nprincipal balance, and (iii) if Excite elects to end your employment for any\nreason and any amount of the principal remains unpaid at the conclusion of your\nemployment with Excite, your repayment of the unpaid loan principal balance will\nbe due within three (3) months thereafter. You may repay the principal balance\nprior to the end of your employment with Excite as follows: (i) in cash or (ii)\non each 12-month anniversary of the loan date, one-fourth (1/4) of the unpaid\nloan principal balance will be forgiven, except to the extent that you exercise\nand sell any of your stock options during such year, in which case all post-tax\nproceeds from any such sale will be immediately applied to the outstanding\nprincipal amount until the principal amount is repaid in full. Interest on the\nloan will be due and payable to Excite on the last day of each 12-month period\non any loan principal amount outstanding during that 12-month period.\n\n< PAGE>   2\nMark Stevens\nJanuary 15, 1999\nPage 2\n\n\n\nYou will be eligible to participate in Excite's group medical, dental, vision,\nlife insurance and 401(k) plan as offered to all full time employees.

Even though your job duties, title, compensation and\nbenefits, as well as Excite's human resources policies and procedures, may\nchange from time to time during your tenure with Excite, the \"at will\" nature of\nyour employment is one aspect which may not be changed, except in an express\nwriting signed by the President of Excite.\n\nAs a comprehensive Internet search and navigation network, Excite is involved in\na wide variety of projects involving content from as many different sources on\nthe Internet as possible. As a result, Excite cannot guarantee employees that\nthey will not be exposed to some adult material, either through specific work\nassignments or due to the presence of such material in the work environment.\n\nAny representations contrary to those contained in this letter which may have\nbeen made to you are superseded by this offer.

You will report to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\n\n2. Salary. You will receive a bi-weekly salary of $9,615.38, which annualizes to a yearly salary of $250,000 payable in accordance with the Company’s\npayroll policies, as such policies may change from time to time (the “Salary”).

These approximate percentage components may change in subsequent fiscal years.

Any Parachute Gross-Up otherwise required by this Section shall not be made later than the time of the corresponding payment or\nbenefit hereunder giving rise to the underlying Section 4999 excise tax, even if the payment of the excise tax is not required under the Code until a later time.\n\n(ii) Subject to the provisions of Section 3(d) and except as may otherwise be agreed to by the Company and the Executive,\nthe amount or amounts (if any) payable under this Section 3 shall be as conclusively determined by the KPMG LLP, or such other firm as mutually agreed to by the Company and the Executive (“Independent Tax Counsel”), whose determination or\ndeterminations shall be final and binding on all parties. The Executive shall agree to utilize such determination or determinations, as applicable, in filing all of the Executive’s tax returns with respect to the excise tax imposed by Section\n4999 of the Code, if any. If such Independent Tax Counsel fails or refuses to make the required determinations for any reason, then such determinations shall be made by a comparable firm or group of national reputation to which the parties\nreasonably mutually agreed. All fees and expenses of the Independent Tax Counsel or its replacement shall be paid by the Company.\n\n(iii) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Independent Tax\nCounsel hereunder, it is possible that Parachute Gross-Up payments, if any, which will not have been made by the Company, should have been made, together with any interest, penalties or taxes of any kind thereon, consistent with the calculations\nrequired to be made hereunder (an “Underpayment”). The Company shall pay all such Underpayments to or for the benefit of the Executive.

McGrane (the “Executive”).\n\nWHEREAS, the Company is the operating subsidiary of Firearms Training Systems, Inc. (the “Parent”), a leading worldwide provider of small and supporting arms training simulators; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Company desires to employ the Executive to serve as Chief\nOperating Officer of the Company, and the Executive desires to be employed by the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements contained herein, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows:\n\n\n1. Employment. The Company hereby agrees to\nemploy the Executive and the Executive hereby agrees to be employed by the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement. The term of employment of the Executive by the Company pursuant to this Agreement (the\n“Employment Period”) shall commence on June 27, 2005 (the “Effective Date”) and shall end on the third anniversary of the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 4 hereof.\n\n2. Position and Duties; Responsibilities. (a) Position and\nDuties. The Company shall employ the Executive during the Employment Period as its Chief Operating Officer.

During the Employment Period, the Executive shall perform\nfaithfully and loyally and to the best of the Executive’s abilities the duties assigned to the Executive hereunder and shall devote the Executive’s full business time, attention and effort to the affairs of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, and shall use the Executive’s best efforts to promote the interests of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Parent. The Executive may engage in charitable, civic or community activities and, with the prior approval of the Board\nof Directors, may serve as a director of any other business corporation, provided that such activities or service do not interfere with the Executive’s duties hereunder or violate the terms of any of the covenants contained in Sections 6, 7, 8,\n9 or 10 hereof.\n\n(b) Responsibilities. Subject to\nthe powers, authority and responsibilities vested in the Board and in duly constituted committees of the Board, the Executive shall have the authority and responsibility for the Company’s management. The Executive shall also perform such other\nduties (not inconsistent with the position of Chief Operating Officer) on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries as may from time to time be authorized or directed by the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Compensation. (a) Base Salary. During the Employment Period, the Company shall\npay to the Executive a base salary at the rate of $275,000.00 per annum (“Base Salary”), payable in accordance with the Company’s executive payroll policy.

During the Employment Period, the Company shall provide the Executive the opportunity to earn an annual merit-based bonus of up\nto fifty percent (50%) of this Base Salary, based upon the Company’s performance, the Executive’s individual performance and the Company prospects and liquidity position (the “Annual Bonus”). The actual amount of such Annual\nBonus shall be determined by the Board after the end of the Company’s fiscal year, in its sole discretion; provided, however, that in no event may the Executive receive an Annual Bonus in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the\nExecutive’s Base Salary. In addition, in the event of a Sale of the Parent (defined as the acquisition of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the Parent’s common stock outstanding by a single party), Executive will be entitled to receive\nthe maximum Annual Bonus of fifty percent (50%) of his Base Salary for the fiscal year in which the Sale of the Parent takes place as long as he remains employed by the Company through the end of that fiscal year or is terminated by the Company\nother than for Cause. Payment of the Annual Bonus in such circumstances will not reduce any payments to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement.\n\n(c) Stock Options.

Other vesting terms and conditions will be substantially similar to those contained in the Company’s existing option grants, including becoming 100% vested and exercisable upon the Sale of the Parent.\n\n(d) Other Benefits. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall\nbe entitled to participate in the Company’s employee benefit plans that are generally available from time to time to executives of the Company, including group medical, dental, life, accidental death and dismemberment, short-term disability,\nlong-term disability, business travel accident plans, sick leave, vacation, and the profit sharing retirement plan (all such benefits being hereinafter referred to as the “Employee Benefits”).\n\n(e) Expense Reimbursement.

Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that the Company, its subsidiaries and the Parent would be damaged\nirreparably in the event that any provision of Section 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any such nonperformance or\nbreach. Accordingly, the Company and the Parent and their successors and permitted assigns shall be entitled, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent any breach or threatened\nbreach of any of such provisions and to enforce such provisions specifically (without posting a bond or other security).

The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, the issuance of an injunction. However,\neither party may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to any court having jurisdiction over such dispute or controversy and seek interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief until the arbitration award is\nrendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this arbitration provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim relief, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the\nexistence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of the Company and the Executive. The Company and the Executive acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.\nNotwithstanding any choice of law provision included in this Agreement, the United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.\n\n15.

The Employee shall not be required to mitigate\nthe amount of any payment contemplated by this Section 4 (whether by seeking new\nemployment or in any other manner), nor shall any such payment be reduced by any\nearnings that the Employee may receive from any other source.\n\n5.  Limitation on Payments.\n\n(a)  Basic   Rule.   Any   other   provision   of  this   Agreement\nnotwithstanding,  the  Company  shall not be required to make any payment to, or\nfor the benefit of, the Employee  (under this Agreement or otherwise) that would\nbe  nondeductible  by the  Company  by reason of  Section  280G of the  Internal\nRevenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended  (the  \"Code\"),  or that would  subject  the\nEmployee  to  the  excise  tax  described  in  Section  4999  of the  Code.  All\ncalculations  required by this Section 5 shall be  performed by the  independent\nauditors  retained by the Company most  recently  prior to the Change in Control\n(the \"Auditors\"), based on information supplied by the Company and the Employee,\nand shall be binding on the Company and the  Employee.  All fees and expenses of\nthe Auditors shall be paid by the Company.\n\n(b)  Reductions.  If the amount of the  aggregate  payments  to the\nEmployee must be reduced under this Section 5, then the Employee shall direct in\nwhich order the payments  are to be reduced,  but no change in the timing of any\npayment shall be made without the Company's consent.  As a result of uncertainty\nin the  application  of  Sections  280G  and  4999 of the Code at the time of an\ninitial  determination by the Auditors hereunder,  it is possible that a payment\nwill  have  been  made by the  Company  that  should  not  have  been  made  (an\n\"Overpayment\") or that an additional payment that will not have been made by the\nCompany  could  have  been  made  (an  \"Underpayment\").  In the  event  that the\nAuditors, based on the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service\nagainst  the  Company  or the  Employee  that the  Auditors  believe  has a high\nprobability  of  success,  determine  that an  Overpayment  has been made,  such\nOverpayment  shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Employee that he\nshall repay to the Company,  together  with interest at the  applicable  federal\nrate specified in Section  7872(f)(2) of the Code;  provided,  however,  that no\namount shall be payable by the Employee to the Company if and to the extent that\nsuch payment  would not reduce the amount that is  nondeductible  under  Section\n280G of the Code or is subject to an excise\n\n\n27\n\n< PAGE>\n\ntax under  Section 4999 of the Code.  In the event that the  Auditors  determine\nthat an Underpayment has occurred,  such Underpayment  shall promptly be paid or\ntransferred  by the Company to, or for the  benefit of, the  Employee,  together\nwith interest at the applicable  federal rate specified in Section 7872(f)(2) of\nthe Code.\n\n6.  Successors.\n\n(a) Company's  Successors.

The  Company's\nfailure to obtain such  agreement  prior to the  effectiveness  of a  succession\nshall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Employee to all of the\ncompensation and benefits to which he would have been entitled  hereunder if the\nCompany had  involuntarily  terminated his employment  without Cause immediately\nafter such succession become  effective.  For all purposes under this Agreement,\nthe term \"Company\" shall include any successor to the Company's  business and/or\nassets which  executes and delivers the assumption  agreement  described in this\nSubsection 6(a) or which becomes bound by this Agreement by operation of law.\n\n(b)  Employee's  Successors.  This  Agreement and all rights of the\nEmployee  hereunder  shall inure to the benefit of, and be  enforceable  by, the\nEmployee's  personal  or  legal  representatives,   executors,   administrators,\nsuccessors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.\n\n7.  Miscellaneous Provisions.\n\n(a) Notice.  Notices and all other  communications  contemplated by\nthis  Agreement  shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given\nwhen personally delivered or when mailed by U.S. registered mail, return receipt\nrequested and postage prepaid. In the case of the Employee, mailed notices shall\nbe addressed to him at the home address which he most recently  communicated  to\nthe Company in writing.  In the case of the  Company,  mailed  notices  shall be\naddressed to its  corporate  headquarters,  and all notices shall be directed to\nthe attention of its Secretary.\n\n(b) Waiver.  No  provision  of this  Agreement  shall be  modified,\nwaived or discharged unless the  modification,  waiver or discharge is agreed to\nin  writing  and  signed by the  Employee  and by an  authorized  officer of the\nCompany (other than the  Employee).  No waiver by either party of any breach of,\nor of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other\nparty shall be  considered  a waiver of any other  condition or provision of the\nsame condition or provision at another time.\n\n\n28\n\n< PAGE>\n\n(c) No Setoff; Withholding Taxes. There shall be no right of setoff\nor counterclaim, with respect to any claim, debt or obligation, against payments\nto the Employee  under this  Agreement.  All payments made under this  Agreement\nshall be subject to a reduction to reflect taxes required to be withheld by law.\n\n(d) Choice of Law. The validity,  interpretation,  construction and\nperformance  of this  Agreement  shall be  governed  by the laws of the State of\nCalifornia.\n\n(e)  Severability.   The  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of  any\nprovision  or  provisions  of this  Agreement  shall not affect the  validity or\nenforceability of any other provision  hereof,  which shall remain in full force\nand effect.\n\n(f)  Arbitration.

In the event EMPLOYEE is terminated without Cause or by EMPLOYEE for GOOD REASON, EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYER shall immediately enter into an independent contractor/consultant agreement\npursuant to which EMPLOYEE shall receive pay in an amount equal to twelve (12) months base salary only (hereinafter “Consultancy Pay”) in exchange for consulting services. The term of the consultancy will be for 12 months after the date of\nEMPLOYEE’s termination (“Consulting Period”). EMPLOYEE agrees to make himself or herself available to EMPLOYER for up to ten (10) hours per week, whether by telephone, e-mail, or in person, on an as-needed basis to consult with\nrespect to matters that were within EMPLOYEE’s job description during the course of EMPLOYEE’s employment. EMPLOYEE agrees to respond promptly, reasonably and cooperatively to EMPLOYER’s requests for assistance. Barring special\ncircumstances, the consulting\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhours shall not be cumulative; accordingly, hours not used within a given week will be waived by the\nEMPLOYER, but EMPLOYEE will receive his or her full pay under this paragraph. However, EMPLOYER reserves the right to require EMPLOYEE to provide more than ten (10) hours of service per week in the event that special circumstances arise in which\nEMPLOYEE’s unique assistance is required by EMPLOYER. (Examples of special circumstances include, but are not limited to assistance in litigation or responding to government inquiries). In order to protect EMPLOYER’s confidential and trade\nsecret information from use or disclosure to a party other than the EMPLOYER, and to enable the Company to be able to obtain the benefits of EMPLOYEE’s consulting obligations hereunder, EMPLOYEE agrees that so long as he is accepting\nConsultancy Pay pursuant to this section, he (a) will not accept employment or consulting work in any capacity with any competitor of EMPLOYER; and (b) will continue to abide by the provisions of paragraphs 8, and 9, below. In the event that\nEMPLOYEE accepts subsequent employment or other consulting work within the Consulting Period, EMPLOYEE will be required to spend no more than five (5) hours per week consulting with EMPLOYER. EMPLOYEE understands that this is a material term of this\nAgreement.\n\nIncentive Pay. In the event\nEMPLOYEE is terminated without Cause, EMPLOYEE, at EMPLOYER’S discretion, shall be entitled to Incentive Pay in an amount equal to the pro-rata portion of incentive pay for the period of employment beginning January 1st of the year in which the termination occurs and ending the date of termination. The full amount, at EMPLOYER’S\ndiscretion, of pro-rated Incentive Pay will be paid to EMPLOYEE in one lump sum payment made within thirty (30) days after the EMPLOYEE’S termination date.\n\nHealth Benefits. EMPLOYEE is entitled to continue Health Benefits coverage pursuant to the terms of\nCOBRA if EMPLOYEE is terminated by EMPLOYER without cause.\n\nStock Options and Restricted Stock. The vesting period for the year in which the termination occurs will accelerate to the date of termination. In other words, upon termination without cause, EMPLOYEE shall\nimmediately be vested with all stock options and restricted that would have been vested at the end of he year in which the termination occurred. All other vesting ceases upon termination. The provisions of the Stock Option Agreement will otherwise\nbe controlling.\n\n10. CHANGE IN CONTROL.

This provision acts in concert with Section 1, Employment by Company, which requires EMPLOYEE to devote all of EMPLOYEE’S\neffort and skill exclusively to EMPLOYER.\n\nUpon\nTermination of Employment. EMPLOYEE agrees that he/she will not seek or accept employment with any business in direct competition with EMPLOYER for a period of one year after termination of the employment relationship, anywhere in the United\nStates. EMPLOYEE further agrees that for a period of one year, he/she will neither contact nor solicit business from any employee, customer or independent contractor, past, present or future, of the EMPLOYER.\n\n12.

EMPLOYEE further understands and agrees that any and all of the above produced or used by EMPLOYEE during\nthe period of employment belongs to EMPLOYER and not to EMPLOYEE.\n\nIn recognition that the business of EMPLOYER and the nature of EMPLOYEE’S work will require EMPLOYEE to have access to confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information of EMPLOYER and/or its clients\nwhich, if disclosed in an unauthorized manner, could be highly prejudicial to EMPLOYER and/or its clients:\n\n\n1.\tEMPLOYEE agrees not to disclose in any manner any confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information, either directly or indirectly, either during employment with EMPLOYER\nor following termination of employment, except as required in the course of employment with EMPLOYER.\n\n\n\n2.\tEMPLOYEE agrees to take all precautions reasonably necessary to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure, or dissemination of confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret\ninformation either during employment with EMPLOYER or following termination of employment.\n\n\n\n3.\tUpon termination, EMPLOYEE will immediately turn over to EMPLOYER all confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret documents, lists and records, or other writings or personal\nproperty relating to the business of the EMPLOYER in any manner obtained during the term of employment. EMPLOYEE hereby agrees and understands that all loans, loan files, loan documentation, client lists and potential client lists are the possession\nand property of EMPLOYER. Upon termination, EMPLOYEE shall cease using, shall immediately return, and shall not misappropriate or use any loans, loan files, loan documentation, client lists or potential client lists. In addition, upon termination,\nEMPLOYEE shall leave in possession of EMPLOYER all equipment, furniture and supplies owned or leased by EMPLOYER.\n\n\nEMPLOYEE recognizes and acknowledges that none of the above provisions or EMPLOYER”S exercise of any rights thereunder shall limit\nthe rights of EMPLOYER under applicable statutes and common law rules regarding trade secrets, including, without limitation, the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.

The Entire Agreement can be modified only by a written instrument executed by EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYER’S President, on behalf of\nthe EMPLOYER. Section Headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.\n\n16.

{"content": "EX-10.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT 10.41\n\n\n\n\nJuly 20, 2004\n\n\n\n\nMr. Richard R. Grigg\n\n13000 West Hawthorne Lane\n\nNew Berlin, WI 53151\n\n\n\nDear Dick:\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this letter agreement (“Agreement”) is to set forth the\ngeneral terms and conditions of your employment as Executive Vice President and\nChief Operating Officer of FirstEnergy Corp. (“FirstEnergy” or the “Company”).\n\n\n\nYour employment with the Company will commence on the Effective Date of\nthis Agreement (as defined below). Your duties and responsibilities as\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer will be commensurate with\nthose customarily performed, undertaken and exercised by persons situated in a\nsimilar executive capacity, including, without limitation responsibility for\nthe FirstEnergy Fossil, Energy Delivery and Commodity Business Units and such\nother duties as may be assigned from time to time. In consideration of your\nperformance of such duties you will be compensated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n(a)\t \tBase Salary. You will receive a base salary (the “Base\nSalary”) at an annual rate of Six Hundred Thousand Dollars\n($600,000) which will be payable in accordance with the existing\npayroll practices of FirstEnergy. The Base Salary will be reviewed\nat least annually at the same time as the base salaries of\nFirstEnergy’s other senior executive officers.\n\n(b)\t \tAnnual Bonus. You will become a participant in FirstEnergy’s\nExecutive and Director Incentive Compensation Plan (“EICP”) and be\neligible to receive an annual bonus each year under the Short-Term\nIncentive Program (“STIP”) component of the EICP (or any successor\nprogram). Your annual short-term target opportunity will be set by\nthe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the same\ntime as other senior executive officers. For the remainder of the\n2004 payroll year your target bonus opportunity will be 70% of the\nBase Salary paid to you during that time. Any annual incentive\ncompensation awarded to you will be payable in accordance with the\nprovisions of the STIP. Note that any award based on performance\nduring 2004 as well as for the year in which your employment ends\nshall be prorated based on the actual time worked during such years.\nThe Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”), which serve as the basis\nfor determining the amount of the annual bonus earned, will be set\nand approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and provided to you\nas soon as practicable thereafter.\n\n(c)\t \tLong-Term Incentive Compensation. In lieu of participation\nin FirstEnergy’s Long-Term Incentive Program (“LTIP”), a component\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe EICP, for the year 2004, the Company will grant you\nnon-qualified stock options to purchase shares of FirstEnergy\ncommon stock on the Effective Date covering an approximate stock\nvalue of 200% of the amount of Base Salary payable to you between\nthe Effective Date and the end of the 2004 payroll year, such\nstock value being a binomial value of $7.67 per option. The\nOption Price of the shares underlying the options will be equal to\nthe average price of FirstEnergy’s common stock on the New York\nStock Exchange on the Effective Date and rounded to the closest\nnumber of whole shares. The options will be granted under and\nsubject to the terms of the Company’s EICP and will carry a\nten-year term with four-year equal annual step vesting. You will\nreceive a Stock Option Agreement setting forth additional terms of\nthe grant. For purposes of the Stock Option Agreement, you will\nbe deemed to have retired if you work at least three years from\nthe Effective Date of this Agreement.\n\nThe LTIP is currently under review by the Company, and we expect\nthe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to approve a\nnew LTIP design at the Committee’s September 2004 meeting. For\nthe 2005 payroll year and all subsequent payroll years during your\nemployment, you will be eligible for a long-term incentive\nopportunity consistent with the approved and redesigned LTIP. Any\nincentive compensation awarded to you will be payable according to\nthe provisions of the LTIP. Any award based on performance during\nthe year in which your employment ends shall be prorated based on\nthe actual time worked during such year and paid in accordance\nwith the terms of the LTIP. In the absence of the foregoing\nprovisions of this Agreement, your 2004 total target incentive\nopportunity under the EICP would have been 240% of your base\ncompensation, such percentage being comprised of a 70% STIP\nopportunity and 170% LTIP opportunity. Your 2005 total target\nincentive opportunity will be set and approved by the Company’s\nBoard of Directors based on competitive data at the same time as\nother senior executive officers.\n\n(d)\t \tChange in Control Agreement. As a result of the passage of\na non-binding proposal by a shareholder with respect to future\nchange in control agreements, the Board of Directors is currently\nreviewing this matter and has not yet determined what course of\naction, if any, it might take in response. After completion of that\nreview, a change in control agreement will be extended to you on\nthe terms approved by the Board of Directors and consistent with its\ncourse of action in response to the shareholder proposal.\n\n(e)\t \tEmployee Benefits. The Company maintains a Flexible Benefits\nPlan that includes programs providing health care insurance, dental\ninsurance, group term life insurance, accident death and\ndismemberment insurance, long term disability, long term care,\ndependent care and health care spending accounts.

You will be eligible to participate in any\nand all of FirstEnergy’s qualified and non-qualified pension,\nretirement, and deferred compensation plans, programs, policies, and\narrangements as they relate to FirstEnergy’s senior executive\nofficers with the exception of the Supplemental Executive\nRetirement Program (“SERP”). Your participation in any of the\nprograms for which you are eligible will be on the same terms and\nconditions as applicable to other participants in those programs and\nwill be governed by the applicable plan documents.\n\nIn lieu of participation in the SERP, you will receive a grant of\nrestricted FirstEnergy common stock on the Effective Date with an\napproximate value of $500,000. The number of shares of restricted\nstock granted will be equal to such value divided by the average\nprice of the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange\non the Effective Date and rounded to the closest number of whole\nshares. The restricted stock will be granted under and subject to\nthe terms of the Company’s EICP and will 100% vest three years\nfrom the date granted. Should your employment continue beyond\nsuch time, you will not be permitted to sell the shares (other\nthan the minimum amount necessary to pay for the associated taxes)\nuntil such time your employment terminates. A Restricted Stock\nAgreement will be prepared outlining the specific details.\n\n(g)\t \tExpenses.

You agree to either resign from or not\nbegin, as appropriate, any term of office as a Director of Allete or\nof any other Company. You further agree to obtain all appropriate\nwritten assurances as determined to be sufficient by FirstEnergy\nfrom Wisconsin Energy Corporation that your acceptance of employment\nwith FirstEnergy does not violate any noncompetition covenants that\nmay be in effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is anticipated that you will begin working on or about August 20, 2004 or\nsuch later date on which the conditions noted in subparagraph (j) above, have\nbeen satisfied. August 20, 2004, or such later date, shall be considered the\nEffective Date of this Agreement. This Agreement will expire three (3) years\nfrom the Effective Date, unless either terminated early by either party for any\nreason upon written notice given 60 days in advance, or mutually extended in\nwriting. This offer is contingent upon your taking and passing a\npre-employment physical, which includes a drug and alcohol test.

{"content": "Exhibit 10.1\n\n\n\nFebruary 16, 1998\n\nMr. John A. Shaw\n2410 White Horse Road\nBerwyn,  PA   19312\n\nDear John:\n\nIt is with great  pleasure  that we welcome  you to Virginia  Power.  As we have\ndiscussed,  your  employment  will begin March 16,  1998,  based on the Board of\nDirectors  electing you as an officer on February  20, 1998.  Your title will be\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Virginia Power.\n\nThe terms of your employment agreement are as follows:\n\nDuties\n\nBoth  you and the  Company  agree  that you  will  serve in a senior  management\nposition.  You agree to (i) devote your  knowledge,  skill and best efforts on a\nfull-time  basis to performing  your duties and obligations to the Company (with\nthe  exceptions  of absences on the account of illness or vacation in accordance\nwith the Company's policies and civic and charitable commitments not involving a\nconflict with the Company's  business),  and (ii) comply with the lawful and non\narbitrary  directions  and orders of the Board of Directors and Chief  executive\nOfficer of the Company with respect to the performance of your duties.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECT COMPENSATION\n\nYour total direct  compensation will consist of three  components:  base salary,\nannual incentive, and long-term incentive.\n\nBase Salary\n\nYour initial base salary will be $240,000,  paid monthly on or about the 25th of\nthe month. Each fall,  officer's  salaries are normally reviewed by the Virginia\nPower Board of Directors and any changes will take effect on the following March\n1. You will  participate  in the base  salary  program  on the same terms as all\nother elected officers.\n\n\n\n< PAGE>\n\nMr. Shaw\nPage 2\n\n\nAnnual Incentive\n\nYour  annualized  incentive  target for 1998 is $114,100 and is based on meeting\ncorporate  and business  goals for the calendar  year 1998.  For 1998,  you will\nreceive a pro-rata  award of  one-twelfth  for every  full  month of  employment\nduring 1998, or a target of $85,575. Annual incentive awards are approved by the\nBoard and are paid during the first quarter of the following year (e.g.,  awards\nfor 1998  will be paid in the first  quarter  of 1999).  The Board  reviews  the\nprogram each  February,  and approves the current year targets at that time. You\nwill participate in the annual incentive  program on the same terms as all other\nelected officers.\n\nLong - Term Incentive\n\nEvery year we begin a new three-year plan cycle. For each partial cycle in which\nyou  participate  you will receive a pro rata  distribution  from the plan.  For\nexample,  when you complete the 1998 - 2000 three-year  cycle,  you will receive\n33/36 of the final award  distribution  (representing  your  participation  from\nApril 1, 1998 through  December 31, 2000).  Your 100% target for the 1998 - 2000\ncycle is $157,000,  which will be prorated to $143,917.  Shares of stock will be\nissued at the completion of the cycle based on the then-current  value per share\nand in compliance  with the guidelines of the long-term  plan.  These plans will\ncontinue  at the  discretion  of the  Virginia  Power Board of  Directors.  Your\nparticipation  in the long-term  incentive plan will be on the same terms as all\nother elected officers.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE INDIRECT COMPENSATION\n\nQualified Pension Plan\n\nAs stated in your offer  letter,  you will be credited  with 20 years of service\nupon attaining age 55 and 30 years of service at age 60.\n\nExecutive Supplement Retirement Plan (ESRP)\n\nOfficers  who  retire  with a  minimum  of five  years of  service  as a company\nemployee receive additional payments for 10 years. The annual benefit is payable\non a  monthly  basis  and is equal to 25% of final  annual  compensation.  Final\nannual compensation is defined as the base salary at the time of retirement plus\na  percentage  (currently  95%) of the annual  incentive  target.  The plan also\nprovides for payments to begin if you die or become disabled before  retirement.\nIf you die after  retirement,  but before receiving ten years of benefits,  your\nbeneficiary will receive the remaining payments. At retirement, you may elect to\nreceive an actuarially  reduced payment for up to 16 years.  There is a\n\n\n< PAGE>\n\nMr. Shaw\nPage 3\n\nseparate calculation for participants having a minimum of five years service but\nretiring before age 55.\n\nExecutive Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan\n\nSince the company  sets base  salaries  below  market,  and since the  qualified\npension is based on actual base  salaries,  executive  pensions  are  calculated\nusing an \"adjusted  base salary for pension  purposes.\"  The  increased  pension\nbenefit cannot,  by law, be paid out of the qualified  pension plan. The Benefit\nRestoration  Plan makes up for the portion of the pension  which  cannot be paid\nfrom the qualified plan.  Federal law also limits the qualified pension coverage\nto the first $160,000 of base salary.  The restoration plan is also used to make\nup for base salary which exceeds the $160,000 cap.\n\nRabbi Trust\n\nFrom time to time, the company makes discretionary  payments into a Rabbi Trust.\nThis account is used to fund the payment of benefits payable under the Executive\nSupplemental Retirement Plan and/or the Executive Retirement Benefit Restoration\nPlan. The funds in the trust can only be used for the executive's  benefit,  and\ncannot revert to the company  under any  circumstances.  Benefits  funded in the\nRabbi Trust are subject to claims of the company's creditors.  The amount of the\ncompany's  contribution  to the trust fund is not taxable to the executive until\nactual payments are made to the executive from the trust.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE PERQUISITES\n\nExecutive Continuity Agreement\n\nThis  \"Golden  Parachute\"  provides  three  years of  protection  for salary and\nincentives in case of a hostile takeover.\n\nCompany Car and Phone\n\nA company car, with cellular phone,  is furnished.  The value of personal use is\nreported as taxable income.\n\nExecutive Accidental Death and Dismemberment\n\nAll executives and spouses are provided  $200,000  coverage for business  travel\naboard  company  aircraft.  However,  as a senior  executive,  you are  provided\n$200,000 coverage for all accidents.  Your spouse receives all accident coverage\nat the lesser rate of $150,000.  These  benefit  amounts are payable for loss of\nlife,  hands,  feet or eyes.  Half the  benefit is payable for loss of one hand,\nfoot, or eye. Coverage ends at age 70.\n\n\n< PAGE>\n\nMr. Shaw\nPage 4\n\nExecutive Deferred Compensation\n\nExecutives may elect to defer part or all of base salary and/or annual incentive\nawards. The election must take place before the period in which the compensation\nis earned. Deferred compensation is subject to Social Security and Medicare tax,\nbut  federal  and state  income  taxes  are  deferred.  No funds or  assets  are\nspecifically set aside for the deferred amount. Deferred compensation is carried\nas a  liability  on the  company  books and the  executive  has the status of an\nunsecured creditor of the company. The deferred amount accumulates \"earnings\" as\nif it were invested in the executive's  choice of an interest bearing account or\nDominion Resources, Inc. Common Stock.\n\nExecutive Physical Examinations\n\nEmployee Health Services schedules executives for annual physical examinations.\n\nExecutive Estate and Tax Planning\n\nThe company pays for an initial  educational  consultation with a local attorney\n(Louis Mezzullo)  specializing in estate planning.  Subsequently,  the executive\nmay choose Mr. Mezzullo or any qualified  professional to aid in the development\nof an initial  estate plan.  The company will  reimburse up to $1,000 toward the\ninitial  estate plan,  and $500 per year,  thereafter,  for an annual review and\nupdate. These taxable reimbursements are paid through payroll.\n\n\nSTANDARD BENEFITS\n\nHealth:  Medical, Drugs, Dental & Vision\n\nEmployees may choose among three deductible/co-pay  options for medical coverage\n(Blue Cross/Blue Shield Preferred  Provider Plan) or one of several HMOs. Dental\nand vision  coverage is available.  All are subsidized and may include  eligible\ndependents.\n\nGroup Life Insurance\n\nUp to three times annual salary coverage is available on a subsidized  basis. An\nadditional  two times  annual  salary is available  on a  non-subsidized  basis.\n$10,000 coverage is available for a spouse; $4,000 for children.\n\nAccidental Death and Dismemberment\n\nUp to three times base salary (as  selected  for group  life) is  available  for\nemployees at no extra charge.\n\n\n\n< PAGE>\n\nMr. Shaw\nPage 5\n\n\nLong-Term Disability\n\nSubsidized  coverage of 60% or 65% of salary is available  after  eligibility is\nestablished. There is a maximum benefit of $10,000 per month.\n\nQualified Pension Plan\n\nAt age 65, the normal  benefit for 30 years of service is  approximately  60% of\nyour final five years average salary, subject to a Social Security offset. It is\nnon-contributory.  Your coverage under  Virginia  Power's  Retirement  Plan will\nbegin after six (6) months of employment.\n\n401(k) Plan and Savings Plan\n\nBoth pre- and post-tax  options are  available.  The company  matches 50% on the\nfirst 6% of salary contributed by the employee, limited to the first $160,000 of\nsalary.\n\nWe believe that this is an excellent  opportunity  for Virginia Power to benefit\nfrom your skills and background, and we look forward to you joining our team.\n\nTo indicate your  acceptance of this offer,  please sign below and return a copy\nto me.\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nNorman Askew\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\nAcknowledged: /s/ John A.

During the Term of this Agreement, any purported termination of the Executive's employment (other than by reason of death) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination from one party hereto to the other parties hereto in accordance with Section 14 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"Notice of Termination\" shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated. Further, a Notice of Termination for Cause is required to include a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters (3/4) of the Board at a meeting of the Board which was called and held for the purpose of considering such termination (after reasonable notice to the Executive an\nd an opportunity for the Executive, together with the Executive's counsel, to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of Cause herein, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.\n\n\n9.2    Date of Termination. \"Date of Termination,\" with respect to any purported termination of the Executive's employment during the Term of this Agreement, shall mean (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by his death, the date of his death, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given (provided that the Executive shall not have returned to the fulltime performance of the Executive's duties during such thirty (30) day period), and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated for any other reason, the date specified in the Notice of Termination (which shall not be less than ninety (90) days (except in the case of a termination for Cause), from the date such Notice of Termination is given).\n\n\n10.     Confidentiality, Noncompetition, and Nonsolicitation.\n\n\n10.1    The Executive will not, during or after the Term, disclose to any entity or person any information which is treated as confidential by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates and is not generally known or available in the marketplace, and to which the Executive gains access by reason of his position as an employee or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (each, an \"EE Entity\").\n\n\n10.2    If, at any time prior to the end of the Term, the Executive terminates his own employment (and not in connection with his Disability, Retirement or death) or the Company terminates his employment with Cause, then for a twelve-month period immediately following his Date of Termination, the Executive shall not, except as permitted by the Company upon its prior written consent, enter, directly or indirectly, into the employ of or render or engage in, directly or indirectly, any services to any person, firm or corporation within the \"Restricted Territory,\" which is a major competitor of any EE Entity with respect to products which any EE Entity is then producing or services any EE Entity is then providing (a \"Competitor\"). However, it shall not be a violation of the immediately preceding sentence for the Executive to be employed by, or render services to, a Competitor, if the Executive renders those services only in lines of business of the Compe\ntitor which are not directly competitive with the primary lines of business of any EE Entity, or are outside of the Restricted Territory. For purposes of this Section 10.2, the \"Restricted Territory\" shall be the states of Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.\n\n\n10.3    If the Executive's employment is terminated for any reason, then for the twelve month period immediately following his Date of Termination the Executive shall not, except as permitted by the Company upon its previous written consent, solicit on his own behalf or on behalf of another person or entity any EE Entity employee for hire or retention as an employee, consultant, or service provider.\n\n\n11.      Successors; Binding Agreement.\n\n\n11.1    In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any successor to the Company or EEMC, the Company or EEMC will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company or EEMC, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company or EEMC would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company or EEMC to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement.  The Parent is a beneficiary of the benefits of this Agreement and shall cause EEMC and Company to fully perform their obligations hereunder.\n\n\n11.2    This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive shall die while any amount would still be payable to the Executive hereunder (other than amounts which, by their terms, terminate upon the death of the Executive) if the Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the executors, personal representatives or administrators of the Executive's estate.\n\n\n12.     Notices.

No waiver by any party hereto at any time of any breach by any other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n\n15.     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.\n\n\n16.     Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration. All claims by the Executive, for benefits under this Agreement shall be directed to and determined by the Board and shall be in writing. Any denial by the Board of a claim for benefits under this Agreement shall be delivered to the Executive in writing and shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial and the specific provisions of this Agreement relied upon.

{"content": "Employment Agreement\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.1\nAugust 6, 2008\nMark T. Thies\n5517 Blue Stem\nCourt\nRapid City, SD 57702\n\n\nRe:\tOffer Letter of Employment\n\nDear Mark:\nThis letter will confirm our recent discussions leading to this offer to you for the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of\nAvista Corporation. We have agreed that your effective date of employment will be September 29, 2008. Your annual salary in your position as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will be $315,000 paid in 26 biweekly increments in\naccordance with Avista Corporation’s normal payroll procedures. You will be eligible to participate in Avista Corporation’s Executive annual incentive plan. For year 2008, the incentive bonus potential for your position as Senior Vice\nPresident is 60% of base salary and would be pro-rated based upon your effective date of employment. Actual incentive bonus payout for officers is determined based on successfully achieving the objectives identified in each annual plan. You will\nalso be eligible to participate in the Executive Performance Share and Restricted Stock Plans. As a Senior Vice President you will be awarded a grant of 12,500 performance shares, with a potential payout of 0% - 150% based on a 3-year performance\ncycle that will end in 2010. You will also receive an initial stock award grant of 2,400 shares of Avista Corp. restricted stock that will vest based upon the terms of the plan. You will also be provided with a Change in Control Contract upon your\nhire date that provides you with benefit protection in the event of a change in control, all as outlined in the contract.\nAs an Avista Corporation employee, you and your eligible family members will be entitled to\nparticipate in the normal benefits package offered to all employees, including medical, vision, and dental coverage. You will also be eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan on the enrollment date that coincides with or immediately follows your\nemployment date (20th of each month, effective on the close of the first pay period in the following month).\nAs an executive of the Company, you will be enrolled in the Executive Income Continuation Plan and the Supplemental Executive Long Term Disability Plan\nupon your completion and execution of the paperwork for these plans. As an executive of the Company, you will be eligible to participate in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), according to the eligibility set forth in the Plan\ndocument with the addition of the following provision.\n\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing 10 years of full-time employment service you will receive a “two for one”\ncredit for Vesting Service for each completed year of full-time service from year ten through year 12 (employment service). Your ten-year employment anniversary triggers commencement of the additional Vesting Service credit. There is no “two\nfor one” credit prior to completion of your tenth year of employment or after completion of your twelfth year of employment. For illustrative purposes, if you terminated your employment at your tenth employment anniversary you would have a\ntotal of eleven years Vesting Service credit in the SERP. As an additional illustration, if instead you terminated your employment at your twelfth employment anniversary you would have a total of fifteen years Vesting Service credit in the SERP.\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Service\nVesting Service\n\n5 years\n5 years\n10 years\n11 years\n11 years\n13 years\n12 years\n15 years\n13 years\n16 years\n14 years\n17 years\n15 years\n18 years\n\nThe Early Retirement Reduction Factors for retirement from active service as described in the\nRetirement Plan for Employees of Avista Corporation will be utilized in determining the benefit payable from the SERP once you reach 15 years of Vesting Service.\nWe have included summaries of all benefits in this packet for your review.\nTo assist with your move to\nSpokane, Avista will provide you with a relocation coordinator and cover the applicable reimbursable amounts of the actual costs of your relocation up to $40,000. The relocation coordinator will explain what costs are covered under the relocation\nguidelines. The Company will pay for reasonable expenses for two round trips for you and your spouse between Rapid City and Spokane, including airfare, lodging, and meals in connection with house-hunting trips of up to seven days each in duration.\nThe Company will also pay for reasonable temporary living expenses for a period of 90 -120 days for food, lodging, and rental car, if necessary, upon arrival in Spokane.\nYou will receive an initial bank of 25 one-leave days immediately upon employment, which can be used in accordance with Avista Corporation policy guidelines for any personal time you may need during your transition\nperiod. Commencing on your employment date, your one leave will be accumulated on an accrual basis each pay period based upon years of service according to the plan provisions.\nPlease note that your acceptance of this offer does not create a contract of continuing employment at Avista Corporation. Your employment with Avista\nCorporation is and will continue to be on an at-will basis; either you or Avista Corporation may terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason not expressly prohibited by law.\n\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, at any time prior to your completing one year of\nfull-time employment with Avista Corporation, the Company chooses to relieve you from your position, other than for Cause, as defined below, or an actual Change in Control event, you will be entitled to receive the severance benefits described in\nthe next paragraph. This entitlement will cease completely at your first year employment anniversary date.

We anticipate six (6) days per calendar month will be worked at the Company’s offices in Portland, Oregon and six (6) days per calendar month from your home in Bend, Oregon. You will\nprovide services to the Company’s Legal Department on a project by project basis as agreed to with the Company’s General Counsel.

Bonus payment will be made at the times and on the conditions set out in the applicable plan.\n\nd. Benefits and Vacation. Because you will be employed less than\nthirty (30) hours per week, your eligibility for Company sponsored benefits will be limited to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan. As a result, your coverage under the Company’s group health plan will terminate on\nJuly 31, 2004 and you may immediately thereafter exercise whatever rights you have under COBRA to continue medical benefits under the Company’s group health plan. Should you elect to exercise your right of continued coverage under COBRA, the\nCompany will pay the full cost of your premium under COBRA (including medical, dental and vision, but excluding medical flexible spending account) for a period of eighteen (18) months following your election of COBRA health care continuation\ncoverage.

You will also be responsible for the cost you will incur to commute from your home in Bend, Oregon to\nPortland (and costs associated with lodging, if any, you incur) in connection with the six (6) days per month that you are required to work at the Company’s offices in Portland. However, if you are asked by the Company to work in the Portland\noffices more than six (6) days per month, or drive your vehicle in connection with your job duties (other than the commute to and from your home), the Company will reimburse you for your mileage in accordance with the then-current standard mileage\nrate established by the Internal Revenue Service. The current rate for 2004 is 37.5 cents per mile. In addition, the Company will reimburse all ordinary and necessary business expenses you reasonably incur in connection with other travel you are\nasked to undertake in connection with your job duties, provided that you account promptly for such expenses to the Company in the manner prescribed from time to time by the Company. Other business related expenses will be reimbursed in accordance\nwith the Company’s expense policy.\n\nf. Duration of\nAssignment.

The\nprovisions of this agreement are severable, and if any part is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, the other provisions of this agreement shall remain fully valid and enforceable to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law. Any court or\narbitrator having jurisdiction over such matters shall have the power to reform such unlawful or unenforceable provision to the extent necessary for such provision to be enforceable to the fullest extent under applicable law.\n\nYou acknowledge that you voluntarily agreed to and accepted the position of\nVice President of Corporate Affairs under the terms and conditions stated herein. You and the Company agree that this assignment does not constitute a termination in your employment with the Company for any purpose and that this change in your\nduties and responsibilities does not give rise to any claim for compensation under any severance plan, agreement or practice, including the Employment Agreement dated December 5, 1997 between you and the Company (the “Original Employment\nAgreement”). In consideration for the benefits and compensation offered under this agreement, you release the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and insurers from, and\nwaive, all claims, if any, which may exist regarding this change of assignment.\n\nConsistent with the Company’s current practices, you agree to execute and deliver and abide by the Confidentiality Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2 (the “Confidentiality\nAgreement”).\n\nThis agreement shall be governed by the laws\nof the State of Oregon, without reference to its choice of law provisions.

This agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupersedes and replaces any and all prior written or oral agreements, including but not limited to your Original\nEmployment Agreement. Any modification of the terms set forth in this agreement will only be effective if done in writing and signed by you and the Company.

For the purposes\nof this paragraph, the term Company includes subsidiaries of the Company.\n\n(b) Death or Disability. If the Employee dies or suffers a disability, (i)\nthe Employee's employment will terminate on the date of his death or Disability,\n(ii) the Company will pay to the Employee or his estate the Employee's Base\nSalary accrued and unpaid to the date on which he died or became disabled, and\n(iii) all the rights and benefits the Employee (or his estate) may have under\nany Company health and welfare benefit plans will be determined in accordance\nwith the terms and conditions of those plans.\n\n(c) Voluntary Termination by Employee. The Employee may voluntarily\nterminate his Employment at any time by providing at least fourteen (14) days'\nprior written notice to the Company, in which event, (i) the Company will pay to\nthe Employee his Base Salary accrued and unpaid to the date the employment\nterminates, and (ii) all the rights and benefits the Employee may have under any\nCompany health and welfare benefit plans will be determined in accordance with\nthe terms and conditions of those plans.\n\n(d) Voluntary Termination by Company. The Company will be entitled to\nterminate the Employee's employment at any time for any reason. The severance\npayment paid to Employee as a result of voluntary termination by the Company\nwill differ depending on whether such termination takes place before or after a\nChange of Control (as defined below) has occurred, as set forth below:\n\n(i) Prior to a Change in Control. If, prior to a Change of Control, the\nCompany terminates the Employee's employment for any reason other than Due\nCause, death or the Employee's disability, then the Company will pay to the\nEmployee his Base Salary in accordance with the then current payroll policies of\nthe Company for a twelve (12)-month period following such termination and all\nthe rights and benefits the Employee may have under any Company health and\nwelfare benefit plans will be determined in accordance with the terms and\nconditions of those plans.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n< PAGE>\n\n(ii) After a Change of Control. If, after a Change of Control, the Company\nterminates the Employee's employment within two (2) years after the date of the\nChange of Control for any reason other than Due Cause, death or the Employee's\ndisability, then the Company will pay to the Employee his Base Salary in\naccordance with the then current payroll policies of the Company for a\ntwenty_four (24)-month period following such termination and all the rights and\nbenefits the Employee may have under the any health and welfare benefit plan\nwill be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of those plans.\n\n\"Change of Control\" means that point in time in which a person, entity or group\nother than (a) the Company or its subsidiaries, or (b) Zapata Corporation (which\nas of the date of this Agreement currently owns approximately sixty-one percent\n(61%) of the Company's outstanding common stock), directly or indirectly\nacquires beneficial ownership of thirty percent (30%) or more of the then\noutstanding shares of common stock of the Company as a result of such\nacquisition (provided, however, that such Change of Control does not occur\nsolely as a result of a reduction in the number of shares of Company common\nstock outstanding due to a repurchase of Company common stock by the Company or\nits subsidiaries).\n\nFor purposes of this Agreement, the Change of Control will be deemed to occur on\nthe effective date on which such person or entity acquires beneficial ownership\nof at least one share greater than thirty percent (30%) of the then outstanding\nshares. Zapata Corporation is not an intended third party beneficiary of this\nAgreement so that if, for example, Zapata Corporation were to sell all of its\nshares of Omega common stock to a third party which, as a result of that\ntransaction, then owned greater than thirty percent (30%) of the Company's then\noutstanding common stock, a Change of Control would have occurred.\n\n4.

If the provisions of this Section 4\nshould ever be deemed to exceed the time, geographic or occupational limitations\npermitted by the applicable law, the Employee and the Company agree that such\nprovisions shall be and are hereby reformed to the maximum time, geographic or\noccupational limitations permitted by the applicable law.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n< PAGE>\n\n5.

{"content": "Exhibit 10.1\n\nEMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT\n\nTHIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”), dated as of this 27th day of June, 2011 (the “Effective Date”), is by and between SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC., a Wisconsin corporation (the “Company”) and DAVID J. VANDER ZANDEN (“Employee”).\n\nRECITALS\n\nThe Company and Employee are parties to an Employment Agreement dated November 5, 2002, as amended effective as of December 31, 2008 (the “2002 Agreement”).\n\nEmployee has indicated his desire to retire effective April 28, 2012 and the Board of Directors of the Company intends to engage in a process to identify Employee’s successor, and the Company and Employee desire to terminate and replace the 2002 Agreement in connection therewith.\n\nThe Company desires to continue to employ Employee and to have the benefit of his skills and services, and Employee desires to accept employment with the Company on the terms and conditions set forth herein.\n\nThis Agreement supersedes and cancels any other prior employment agreements or understandings, written or oral, between the Company and Employee, including the 2002 Agreement.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, terms, covenants and conditions set forth herein, and the performance of each, the parties hereto, intending legally to be bound, hereby agree as follows:\n\nAGREEMENTS\n\n1.\n\nEmployment and Duties.  The Company hereby agrees to employ Employee and Employee hereby accepts employment as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and agrees to devote his full business time and efforts to the diligent and faithful performance of his duties as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company hereunder under the direction of the Board of Directors of the Company.  Such duties shall be performed from the Company’s headquarters in Greenville, Wisconsin.  Subject to Employee’s satisfaction of the condition in Section 8, below, and provided that Employee’s employment has not been terminated pursuant to Section 5(b), 6(a) or 6(b), below, and except as provided in Section 5(c), below, Employee shall be nominated by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) for election to the Board at the 2012 annual meeting of shareholders (the “2012 Meeting”) for a three-year term.\n\n2.\n\nTerm of Employment.  Unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided, the term of Employee’s employment hereunder shall commence with and only with the Effective Date and shall continue until April 28, 2012 (the “Term”).  This Agreement may be terminated prior to the end of the Term in the manner provided herein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\nCompensation.  For all services rendered by Employee, the Company shall compensate Employee as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nBase Salary.  Effective on the date hereof, the annual base salary payable to Employee shall be Six Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($675,000.00) or such greater amount as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company, payable on a regular basis in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll procedures, but not less than monthly.  This amount is stated before reductions for federal and state income and employment tax withholding.  It is understood that the base salary is a minimum amount, and shall not be reduced during the Term.\n\n(b)\n\nIncentive Bonus.  Provided Employee remains employed by the Company through the last day of the Term, Employee shall be entitled to receive the incentive bonus earned under the Company’s senior management bonus program for the fiscal year ending April 28, 2012, which incentive bonus shall be paid in accordance with the Company’s senior management bonus program, at such time as other members of senior management of the Company receive their incentive bonuses under such program.\n\n(c)\n\nPerquisites, Benefits, and Other Compensation.  While employed by the Company, Employee shall be entitled to receive all perquisites and benefits as are customarily provided by the Company to its executive employees, subject to such changes, additions, or deletions as the Company may make generally from time to time.\n\n(d)\n\nNon-Vested Stock Units.  The shares of Company common stock earned by Employee under the Fiscal 2010 Performance Share Program shall vest in full and be distributed to Employee upon the earlier of the last day of the Term or upon termination of Employee’s employment pursuant to Section 5, below.\n\n(e)\n\nStock Options.  In the event Employee is nominated for election to the Board at the 2012 Meeting but is not elected, or is not or is unable to be nominated for any reason other than as a result of termination of Employee’s employment pursuant to Section 6(a) or Section 6(b), Employee’s stock options shall be amended to provide for the same vesting and exercisability as if he had been elected to the Board for a three-year term.\n\n(f)\n\nDirector Compensation.  In the event Employee is nominated for election to the Board at the 2012 Meeting but is not elected, or is not or is unable to be nominated for any reason other than as a result of termination of Employee’s employment pursuant to Section 6(a) or Section 6(b), Employee shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three (3) times an amount equal to the sum of (a) the annual cash retainer for a non-employee director who is not a committee chairman in effect as of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nJune 30, 2012 and (b) the Black-Scholes value of the annual equity grant to a non-employee director at the regular meeting of the Board in June 2010.\n\n4.\n\nConfidential Information and Company Property.\n\n(a)\n\nEmployee will acquire information and knowledge respecting the intimate and confidential affairs of the Company in the various phases of its business.  Accordingly, Employee agrees that he shall not for a period of two (2) years following the termination of his employment with the Company, use for himself or disclose to any person not employed by the Company any such knowledge or information heretofore acquired or acquired during the term of this employment hereunder including but not limited to information marked “confidential information.”  Employee agrees to hold all trade secrets, as defined in §134.90 of the Wisconsin Statutes and as hereinafter amended from time to time, in strict confidence and agrees not to use or disclose such trade secrets in any way following the termination of his employment with the Company at any time.  Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit or supersede the common law of torts or statutory or other protection of trade secrets where such law provides the Company with greater protections or protections for a longer duration than that provided in this Section 4.\n\n(b)\n\nEmployee agrees that all memoranda, notes, records, papers or other documents and all copies thereof relating to the Company’s operations or business, some of which may be prepared by him, and all objects associated therewith (such as models and samples) in any way obtained by him shall be the Company’s property.  This shall include, but is not limited to, documents and objects concerning any process, apparatus, or product manufactured, used, developed, investigated, or considered by the Company.  Employee shall not, except for Company use, copy or duplicate any of the aforementioned documents or objects, nor remove them from the Company’s facilities, nor use any information concerning them except for the Company’s benefit, either during his employment or thereafter.  Employee agrees that he will deliver all of the aforementioned documents and objects that may be in his possession to the Company on termination of his employment, or at any other time on the Company’s request, together with his written certification of compliance, except for those documents and objects received as a director of the Company.\n\n5.\n\nRemoval from Office; Termination of Employment for Death, Disability and\n\nWithout Cause.\n\n(a)\n\nThe Board may remove Employee from the position of Chief Executive Officer and President in connection with its process of identifying and hiring Employee’s successor and specifying the first date of employment for Employee’s successor.  Upon such removal, Employee will have such duties, if any, as may be prescribed from time to time by the Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nEmployee’s employment shall terminate immediately upon his death.  Should Employee’s employment with the Company be terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 5(b), the Company shall continue to pay to Employee the Base Salary described in Section 3(a), above, through April 28, 2013.  During such period of salary continuation, Employee’s family shall continue to be covered under all health insurance coverage of the Company afforded its senior management, at the then effective cost sharing arrangement between Employee and the Company.  Employee shall also be entitled to receive the incentive bonus that Employee would have earned had Employee’s employment continued through the last day of the fiscal year in which his employment terminates, payable in accordance with the Company’s senior management bonus program, at such time as other members of senior management of the Company receive their incentive bonuses under such program, but prorated on the basis of the number of days during that fiscal year for which Employee was employed by the Company.  In addition, the Company shall provide Employee all benefits accrued through the date of termination of employment under the plans referenced in Section 3(c), above.  The Company shall have no obligation to Employee under any severance pay or similar plan or policy of the Company.\n\n(c)\n\nIn the event the Employee becomes physically or mentally disabled so as to qualify for disability payments under the then current disability coverage for full-time employees of the Company, the Company may at its option terminate Employee’s employment upon not less than thirty (30) days’ written notice.  The Company’s right to terminate the Employee’s employment pursuant to the preceding sentence shall cease in the event the notice of termination provided for therein shall not be given during the period of the Employee’s disability or within ninety (90) days after such disability ceases.  In the event of such termination of employment, the Company shall be obligated to pay to Employee the Base Salary described in Section 3(a), above, reduced by the gross amount of the Company-provided disability payments received by the Employee, through April 28, 2013.  During such period of salary continuation, Employee and his family shall continue to be covered under all health insurance coverage of the Company afforded its senior management, at the then effective cost sharing arrangement between Employee and the Company.  Employee shall also be entitled to receive the incentive bonus that Employee would have earned had Employee’s employment continued through the last day of the fiscal year in which his employment terminates, payable in accordance with the Company’s senior management bonus program, at such time as other members of senior management of the Company receive their incentive bonuses under such program, but prorated on the basis of the number of days during that fiscal year for which Employee was employed by the Company.  In addition, the Company shall provide Employee all benefits accrued through the date of termination of employment under the plans referenced in Section 3(c), above.  The\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nCompany shall have no obligation to Employee under any severance pay or similar plan or policy of the Company.  In the event Employee’s disability would prevent him from reasonably carrying out the duties of a director of the Company, the Board shall not be obligated to nominate Employee for election to the Board at the 2012 Meeting.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Company may at its option and for any reason terminate Employee’s employment upon not less than thirty (30) days’ written notice.  Should Employee’s employment with the Company be terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 5(d), the Company shall continue to pay to Employee the Base Salary described in Section 3(a), above, through April 28, 2013.  To the extent not previously paid to Employee, Employee shall also be entitled to receive the incentive bonus that Employee would have earned had Employee’s employment continued through the last day of the Term, payable in accordance with the Company’s senior management bonus program, at such time as other members of senior management of the Company receive their incentive bonuses under such program.  In addition, if Employee’s employment terminates prior to the end of the Term, Employee and his family shall continue to be covered until April 28, 2013 under all health insurance coverage of the Company afforded its senior management, at the then effective cost sharing arrangement between Employee and the Company, provided that the subsidy Employee receives from the Company shall be taxable income to him.  Finally, the Company shall provide Employee all benefits accrued through the date of termination of employment under the plans referenced in Section 3(c), above.  The Company shall have no obligation to Employee under any severance pay or similar plan or policy of the Company.\n\n6.\n\nTermination of Employment For Cause; Voluntary Termination.\n\n(a)\n\nThe Company reserves the right to immediately terminate Employee’s employment under this Agreement should any of the following occur:\n\n(i)\n\nEmployee’s commission of a felony that is an act which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, is either abhorrent to the community or is an intentional act, which the Board of Directors considers materially damaging to the reputation of the Company or its successors or assigns.\n\n(ii)\n\nEmployee’s breach of or failure to perform his obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  However, the right of the Company to terminate the employment of Employee under the terms of this Section 6(a)(ii) shall be conditioned upon the Company promptly providing to Employee a written notice which describes the Employee’s breach or failure to perform his obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Employee shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the Company’s issuance of this notice to cure the described breach or failure.  Notwithstanding the above described language, should the Company issue a notice under the terms of this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nSection 6(a)(ii) (the “First Notice”) and within the twelve month period following such notice issue a second notice under this Section 6(a)(ii) for a breach or failure to perform similar to the breach or failure to perform cited in the First Notice, Employee shall have no cure rights for such breach or failure to perform.\n\n(b)\n\nEmployee reserves the right to immediately terminate Employee’s employment under this Agreement.\n\n\n\nShould Employee’s employment with the Company be terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 6, the Company shall pay to Employee the Base Salary described in Section 3(a) through the date of termination and provide Employee all benefits accrued through the date of termination of employment under the plans referenced in Section 3(c), above.  The Company will have no further obligations to Employee.\n\n7.\n\nDefinition of Termination of Employment; “Special Employee” Delay in\n\nPayments.\n\n(a)\n\nFor all purposes of this Agreement, Employee’s employment shall be treated as if it were terminated if the termination meets the definition of “separation from service” as set forth in Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(h).\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if (i) Employee is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Treas.

SEASOCK (the \"Executive\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWITNESSETH:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHEREAS, Peoples is a bank holding company and is the owner of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Bank; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHEREAS, Peoples, the Bank and the Executive desire to enter into an agreement regarding, among other things, the employment of the Executive by Peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGREEMENT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Employment.  Peoples hereby employs the Executive, and the Executive hereby accepts employment with Peoples, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Duties of Executive.  The Executive shall perform and discharge well and faithfully such duties as an executive officer of Peoples and the Bank as may be assigned to the Executive from time to time by the Board of Directors of Peoples. The Executive shall be employed as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Peoples and the Bank, reporting only to the respective Boards of Directors and President and Chief Executive Officer of Peoples and the Bank.  Executive shall hold such additional titles and powers as may be given to him from time to time by the Board of Directors of Peoples, the Bank, and any companies affiliated with Peoples. The Executive shall devote his full time, atte\nntion and energies to the business of Peoples and its affiliated companies and shall not, during the Employment Period (as defined in Section 3 hereof), be employed or involved in any other business activity, whether or not such activity is pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage; provided, however, that this Section 2 shall not be construed as preventing the Executive from (a) investing the Executive's personal assets, (b) acting as a member of the Board of Directors of any other corporation or as a member of the Board of Trustees of any other organization, provided no such corporation or organization is a direct or indirect competitor of Peoples or any of its affiliated companies, or (c) being involved in any other activity with the prior approval of the Board of Directors of Peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Term of Employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)           The Executive's employment under this Agreement shall be for a period (the \"Employment Period\") commencing upon the effective date of this Agreement and if not previously terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Employment Period shall end three years later.  The Employment Period shall be automatically extended by one year on January 18, 2012, and again on January 18th of each year thereafter, to provide for a three (3) year term, annually, effective as of such respective dates, unless either Peoples or the Executive shall have given written notice of non-extension of the term of this Agreement to the other at least\nninety (90) days before the date of any such extension.  It is the intention of the parties that this Agreement be “Evergreen.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)           Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3(a) of this Agreement, the Executive's employment under this Agreement may be terminated at any time during the Employment Period for \"Cause\" (as herein defined), by action of the Board of Directors of Peoples. As used in this Agreement, \"Cause\" means any of the following events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)           the Executive is convicted of or enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony, a crime of falsehood, or a crime involving fraud or moral turpitude, or the actual incarceration of the Executive for a period of seven (7) consecutive days;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)           the Executive willfully fails to follow the lawful, good faith instructions of the Board of Directors or President and Chief Executive Officer of Peoples after the Executive's receipt of written notice of such instructions, and the Executive fails to cure such failure within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice, other than a failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity because of physical or mental illness; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)           any government regulatory agency orders that Peoples terminate the employment of the Executive or relieve him of his duties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive's employment under this Agreement shall not be deemed to have been terminated for \"Cause\" under Section 3(b)(i) or 3(b)(ii) above if such termination took place solely as a result of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)           questionable judgment on the part of the Executive;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)           any act or omission believed by the Executive, in good faith, to have been in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Peoples or its affiliated companies; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)           any act or omission in respect of which a determination could properly be made that the Executive met the applicable standard of conduct prescribed for indemnification or reimbursement or payment of expenses under the Bylaws of Peoples (or its affiliates) or the directors' and officers' liability insurance of Peoples (or its affiliates), in each case as in effect at the time of such act or omission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Executive's employment is terminated under the provisions of this Section 3(b), then all rights of the Executive under Section 4 hereof shall cease as of the effective date of such termination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)           The Executive's employment under this Agreement may be terminated at any time during the Employment Period without \"Cause\" (as defined in Section 3(b) hereof), by action of the Board of Directors of Peoples, upon giving notice of such termination to the Executive at least thirty (30) days prior to the date upon which such termination shall take effect. If the Executive's employment is terminated under the provisions of this Section 3(c), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive the compensation and benefits set forth in Section 6 or Section 7 hereof, whichever shall be applicable.  A decision by Peoples to not extend this Agreement as set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement shall constitute a terminat\nion without “Cause.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)     In the event of any reduction in title or a reduction in the Executive's responsibilities or authority, including such responsibilities and authority as the same may be increased at any time during the term of this Agreement, a material breach by Peoples or the Bank of this Agreement, or the assignment to the Executive of duties inconsistent with the Executive's status as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Peoples and the Bank, then at the option of the Executive, exercisable by the Executive within one hundred twenty (120) days after the occurrence of each and every of the foregoing events of \"Good Reason\", Executive shall provide notice to Peoples of the existence of the condition and\nprovide Peoples thirty (30) days in which to cure such condition.  In the event that Peoples does not cure the condition within thirty (30) days of such notice, Executive may resign from employment for Good Reason by delivering written notice (\"Notice of Termination\") to Peoples and the provisions of Section 7 shall apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)           If the Executive retires or dies, the Executive's employment under this Agreement shall be deemed terminated as of the date of the Executive's retirement or death, and all rights of the Executive under Section 4 shall cease as of the date of such termination. Any benefits thereafter payable to the Executive shall be determined in accordance with the retirement, insurance and benefit programs of Peoples (and its affiliates) then in effect. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, if the Executive dies after a Notice of Termination is delivered by the Executive, he shall be entitled to the termination benefits otherwise provided herein, and the provisions of Section 16(b) hereof shall apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)     If the Executive becomes disabled, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”) and the regulations thereunder and, as a result thereof is incapable of performing the services required of the Executive under Section 2 of this Agreement for a continuous period of six (6) months, then, upon the expiration of such period or at any time thereafter, by action of the Board of Directors of Peoples, the Executive's employment under this Agreement may be terminated immediately upon giving the Executive notice to that effect. If the Executive's employment is terminated under the provisions of this Section 3(f), then all rights of the Executive under Secti\non 4 hereof shall cease as of the last business day of the week in which such termination occurs. Any benefits thereafter payable to the Executive shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the respective plan documents of the retirement, insurance and benefit programs of Peoples (and its affiliates) then in effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Employment Period Compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Annual Base Salary. For services performed by the Executive under this Agreement, Peoples shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Executive a salary, during the Employment Period, at the rate of One Hundred Forty-Five Thousand Dollars ($145,000.00) per year, payable at the same times as salaries are payable to other executive employees of Peoples.  Peoples shall increase Executive’s salary effective January 1, 2012 and 2013 at a minimum rate of four percent (4%).  Peoples may, from time to time, increase the Executive's salary, as Peoples deems appropriate.  Any and all such increases shall be deemed to constitute amendments to this Section 4(a) to reflect the increased amounts,\neffective as of the dates established for such increases by the Board of Directors of Peoples in the resolutions authorizing such increases (“Annual Base Salary”).  In no event shall Executive’s salary be reduced unless such reduction is the result of a national financial depression or national or bank emergency or when such reduction has been implemented by the Board of Directors for all officers proportionately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Bonus. For services performed by the Executive under this Agreement, Peoples shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Executive a bonus, during the Employment Period, in such amounts and at such times, annually, as is provided in such executive incentive plan for the Executive as shall be approved by the Board of Directors of Peoples and in effect from time to time and which shall be based on the goals and objectives set forth in Peoples’ strategic plan. The bonus will be an amount up to fifteen percent (15%) of Executive’s salary.  In addition, Peoples may, from time to time, pay such other bonus or bonuses to the Executive as Peoples, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. The payment of\nany such bonuses shall not reduce or otherwise affect any other obligation of Peoples to the Executive provided for in this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Automobile. During the term of this Agreement, Peoples shall provide the Executive with an automobile allowance in the amount of $750.00 per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)  Inclement Weather Expenses.  Peoples will reimburse Executive for reasonable hotel and meal expenses in the event that there is inclement weather and the Executive is unable to travel home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.  At least annually, Peoples and Executive shall meet and discuss Peoples providing Executive with a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”).  Part of the discussion and consideration shall be terms to provide for accelerated vesting of benefits in the event of a Change in Control or a termination without Cause, consistent with the definitions of these terms in this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Other Benefits. Peoples will provide (or cause to be provided) the Executive, during the Employment Period, with insurance, paid time off, pension, and other fringe benefits in the aggregate not less favorable than those received by other executive employees of Peoples or the Bank,  provided, however, that immediately upon hire, Executive shall be eligible for family group health insurance benefits and the greater of twenty-three (23) days of paid time off or his paid time off entitlement under the policies and practices of Peoples or the Bank.  In addition, during the term of this Agreement, Executive shall be entitled to participate in or receive the benefits of any employee benefit plan curr\nently in effect at the Bank, subject to the terms of such plans as to eligibility and vesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Resignation of the Executive for Good Reason After a Change In Control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The Executive may resign for \"Good Reason\" (as herein defined) during the two-year period following a \"Change in Control\" (as defined in Section 5(b) hereof), as hereinafter set forth. As used in this Agreement, \"Good Reason\" means any of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) any reduction in title or a reduction in the Executive's responsibilities or authority with respect to Peoples or the Bank, including such responsibilities and authority as the same may be increased at any time during the term of this Agreement, or the assignment to the Executive of duties inconsistent with the Executive's status as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Peoples and the Bank;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) any reassignment of the Executive that is a material change in geographic location  and that requires the Executive to move his principal residence;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) any removal of the Executive from office or any adverse change in the terms and conditions of the Executive's employment, except for any termination of the Executive's employment under the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) any reduction in the Executive's annual base salary as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be increased from time to time;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(v) any failure of Peoples to provide the Executive with benefits at least as favorable as those enjoyed by the Executive under any of the pension, life insurance, medical, health, accident, disability or other employee benefit plans of Peoples (or any affiliated company) in which the Executive participated at the time of the Change in Control, or the taking of any action that would materially reduce any of such benefits in effect at the time of the Change in Control, unless such reduction is part of a reduction applicable to all employees;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(vi) any failure to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume and agree to perform under this Agreement, as contemplated in Section 16(a) hereof; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(viii) any material breach of this Agreement on the part of Peoples or the Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen within one hundred twenty (120) days after the occurrence of each and every of the foregoing events of \"Good Reason” after the occurrence of a Change in Control, at the option of Executive, Executive shall provide notice to Peoples of the existence of the condition and provide Peoples thirty (30) days in which to cure such condition.  In the event that Peoples does not cure the condition within thirty (30) days of such notice, Executive may resign from employment for Good Reason by delivering written notice (\"Notice of Termination\") to Peoples, and the provisions of Section 6 hereof shall thereupon apply.\n\n\n(b) As used in this Agreement, \"Change in Control\" of Peoples or the Bank shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control applicable to the Peoples or the Bank as described in Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(V) (or any successor provision thereto) and the regulations thereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Rights in Event of Certain Termination of Employment After Change in Control. In the event that Executive resigns from employment for Good Reason following a Change in Control, by delivery of a Notice of Termination to Peoples, or Executive's employment is involuntarily terminated by Peoples without Cause after a Change in Control, Peoples shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Executive, within twenty (20) days following termination, a lump sum amount equal to 2.0 times his Annual Base Salary. In addition, Executive shall be entitled to continuation of group health insurance benefits, at the same level enjoyed by Executive immediately preceding the Change in Control, for two (2) years following termination of emplo\nyment.  If Peoples or the Bank is unable to continue group health insurance benefits for Executive because of his termination of employment, then Executive shall be provided, at Peoples and the Bank’s effort and expense, with substantially similar benefits.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event the lump sum payment described in the preceding sentence, when added to all other amounts or benefits provided to or on behalf of the Executive in connection with his termination of employment, would result in the imposition of an excise tax under Code Section 4999, such lump sum shall be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid such imposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Rights in Event of Certain Termination of Employment in Absence of Change in Control. In the event that Executive's employment is involuntarily terminated by Peoples without Cause or Executive resigns from employment for Good Reason and no Change in Control shall have occurred at the date of such termination or resignation, Peoples shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Executive, within twenty (20) days following termination, a lump sum amount equal to 2.0 times his Annual Base Salary. In addition, Executive shall be entitled to continuation of group health insurance benefits, at the same level enjoyed by Executive immediately preceding the termination, for the earlier of two (2) years following termination of empl\noyment or until he secures benefits from another employer.  If Peoples or the Bank is unable to continue group health insurance benefits for Executive because of his termination of employment, then Executive shall be provided, at Peoples and the Bank’s effort and expense, with substantially similar benefits.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event the lump sum payment described in the preceding sentence, when added to all other amounts or benefits provided to or on behalf of the Executive in connection with his termination of employment, would result in the imposition of an excise tax under Code Section 4999, such lump sum shall be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid such imposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Covenant Not to Compete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The Executive hereby acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the business of Peoples and the Bank and accordingly agrees that, during and for the applicable period set forth in Section 8(c) hereof, the Executive shall not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Be engaged, directly or indirectly, either for his own account or as agent, consultant, employee, partner, officer, director, proprietor, investor (except as an investor owning less than 5% of the stock of a publicly owned company) or otherwise of any person, firm, corporation, or enterprise engaged, in (1) the banking (including bank holding company) or financial services industry, or (2) any other activity in which Peoples or any of its subsidiaries is engaged during the Employment Period, in any county in which, at any time during the Employment Period or at the date of termination of the Executive's employment, a branch, office or other facility of Peoples or any of its subsidiaries is located, including counties located outside of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the \"Non-Competition Area\"); or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Provide financial or other assistance to any person, firm, corporation, or enterprise engaged in (1) the banking (including bank holding company) or financial services industry, or (2) any other activity in which Peoples or any of its subsidiaries is engaged during the Employment Period, in the Non-Competition Area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) It is expressly understood and agreed that, although the Executive and Peoples consider the restrictions contained in Section 8(a) hereof reasonable for the purpose of preserving for Peoples and its subsidiaries their good will and other proprietary rights, if a final judicial determination is made by a court having jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in Section 8(a) hereof is an unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable restriction against the Executive, the provisions of Section 8(a) hereof shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such other extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) The provisions of this Section 8 shall be applicable commencing on the effective date of this Agreement and ending on one of the following dates, as applicable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)           if the Executive's employment terminates in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (other than Section 3(b)), the effective date of termination of employment;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)           if the Executive's employment terminates in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof or the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment, other than in accordance with the provisions of Sections 3(d), 5 or 7, the first anniversary date of the effective date of termination of employment; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)           if the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment in accordance with the provisions of Sections 3(d),  5 or 7, the effective date of termination of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Arbitration. Peoples, the Bank and the Executive recognize that in the event a dispute should arise between them concerning the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement, lengthy and expensive litigation will not afford a practical resolution of the issues within a reasonable period of time. Consequently, each party agrees that all disputes, disagreements and questions of interpretation concerning this Agreement are to be submitted for resolution to the American Arbitration Association (the \"Association\") in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Peoples, or the Executive, may initiate an arbitration proceeding at any time by giving notice to the other in accordance with the rules of the Association. The Association shall\ndesignate a single arbitrator to conduct the proceeding, but Peoples, and the Executive, may, as a matter of right, require the substitution of a different arbitrator chosen by the Association. Each such right of substitution may be exercised only once. The arbitrator shall not be bound by the rules of evidence and procedure of the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania but shall be bound by the substantive law applicable to this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator, absent fraud, duress, incompetence or gross and obvious error of fact, shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be enforceable in courts of proper jurisdiction. Following written notice of a request for arbitration, Peoples, and the Executive, shall be entitled to an injunction restraining all further proceedings in any pending or subsequently filed litigation concerning this Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, in the event any such provision is in confl\nict with a rule or policy of the Association, the arbitration proceeding shall be governed by such rule or policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Legal Expenses. Peoples shall pay to the Executive all reasonable legal fees and expenses, including, without limitation, all fees and expenses incurred by Executive in connection with any arbitration that occurs in accordance with Section 9 of this Agreement, incurred by the Executive in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement, provided that any action or proceeding is not decided against the Executive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Mitigation of Damages. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in Section 6 or Section 7 hereof by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in Section 6 or Section 7 be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment by another employer or by reason of the Executive's receipt of or right to receive any retirement or other benefits after the date of termination of employment or otherwise; provided, however, that the payments provided for in Section 6 or Section 7 shall be reduced by the amount actually received by the Executive under any severance policy of Peoples or the Bank then\nin effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be deemed properly given if in writing and if mailed by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid with return receipt requested, to the residence of the Executive, in the case of notices to the Executive, and to the principal office of Peoples, in the case of notices to Peoples and the Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Waiver. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged unless such waiver, modification, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and an executive officer of Peoples specifically designated by the Board of Directors of Peoples. No waiver by any party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party hereto, except by Peoples or the Bank to any successor in interest to the business of Peoples and the Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16. Successors, Binding Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)           Peoples will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Peoples to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Peoples would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure by Peoples to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and the provisions of Section 6 hereof shall apply. As used in this Agreement, \"Peoples\" shall mean Peoples as hereinbefore defined and any successor to the respective business and/or assets of Peoples which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by op\neration of law or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)           This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive should die after a Notice of Termination is delivered by the Executive and any amounts would be payable to the Executive under this Agreement if the Executive had continued to live, all such amounts shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other designee, or, if there is none, to the Executive's estate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17. Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19. Headings. The headings of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction or limit the scope or intent of any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20. Termination of Prior Agreements. Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto, any prior agreement relating to the subject matter hereof shall be automatically terminated and be of no further force or effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21. 409A Safe Harbor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)           If when the Executive’s employment terminates, the Executive is a “specified employee,” as defined in Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), then despite any provision of this Agreement or other plan or agreement to the contrary, the Executive will not be entitled to the payments until the earliest of: (a) the date that is at least six months after the Executive’s Separation from Service for reasons other than the Executive’s death, (b) the date of the Executive’s death, or (c) any earlier date that does not result in additional tax or interest to the Executive under Code Section 409A.  As promptly as possible after the end of the period during which payments are delayed under this\nprovision, the entire amount of the delayed payments shall be paid to the Executive in a single lump sum with any remaining payments to commence in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or other applicable plan or agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)           Any payments made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent of payments made from the date of termination through March 15th of the calendar year following such date, are intended to constitute separate payments for purposes of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2) and thus payable pursuant to the “short-term deferral” rule set forth in Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(b)(4); to the extent such payments are made following said March 15th, they are intended to constitute separate payments for purposes of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2) made upon an involuntary termination from service and payable pursuant to Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), to the maximum extent permitted by said provision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)           The parties hereto intend that any and all post-employment compensation under this Agreement satisfy the requirements of Section 409A or an exception or exclusion therefrom to avoid the imposition of any accelerated or additional taxes pursuant to Section 409A.   Any terms not specifically defined shall have the meaning as set forth in Section 409A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment shall be made pursuant to Sections 6 or 7 unless such termination of employment is a “separation of service” as defined in Code Section 409A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties, intending to be legally bound, have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBY:\n\n\n\nPEOPLES FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBY:\n\n\n\nPEOPLES NEIGHBORHOOD BANK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBY:\n\n\nSCOTT A.

You will receive a monthly Base Salary of $33,333.00, which is $400,000.00 annually, inclusive of an annual cash car allowance of\n$14,520.00.

You will be entitled to participate in other management compensation plans, including the Management\nStock Option Plan, the Change in Control Severance Plan at Tier I and the Severance Pay Plan as a Top Employee, as such plans may be amended from time to time.\n\n\n\n4.\tBenefits.

Any\ndiscrepancy between this summary and the company’s plan documents will be resolved in favor of the plan documents. Our benefits program, compensation programs, and policies are reviewed from time to time by Company management and may be\nmodified, amended, or terminated at any time.\n\n\n\n5.\tExpenses. The Company will reimburse you for your business expenses in accordance with its policies.\n\n\n\n6.\tSecondment. You will be assigned to work in the Company’s office in London, England, though the Company reserves the right to require you to work from another location\non a temporary basis or to transfer you to another office or to an affiliated company. Your assignment is expected to continue for a maximum of two years unless we otherwise mutually agree. In addition to your regular compensation, as set forth in\nSection 3 of this Agreement, during the time you are assigned to the Company’s London office you will be eligible for the following expatriate benefits:\n\n\n(a) Contingent Allowance. The Company will provide you with a Contingent Allowance of £27,548 per year, paid in\nequal monthly installments, in recognition of the higher cost of living in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jeff Scherb\nSeptember 15, 2005\nPage\n3\n\n\n\n(b) Relocation Expenses. The Company will reimburse you for the following expenses related to\nyour relocation:\n\n\n•\t \tReasonable moving expenses for normal household goods from Elmira, New York to London.\n\n\n\n•\t \tReasonable necessary additional fit-out costs for your accommodation.\n\n\n\n•\t \tBusiness class flights for you and those family members who will be relocating with you.\n\n\nIt is anticipated that the total cost will be no more than £26,000 and will be reimbursed to you subject to the\nprovision of actual expenses invoiced.\n\n(c) Housing\nExpenses. The Company will rent or lease on your behalf accommodation of your choice within commuting distance of London and will contribute up to a maximum value of £7,346 per calendar month towards your housing costs (covering rent,\nmanagement fees, government rates and utilities). The Company will recover from you on a monthly basis any amount that it spends on your behalf over and above this figure. The Company will also cover any realtor brokerage costs and deposit\nrequirements related to your housing.\n\nDuring the period\nbefore you locate permanent housing, the Company will provide appropriate transitional accommodation in either a hotel or serviced apartment for a period estimated to be one month. Other than as set forth herein, the costs associated with providing\nyou housing will not be deducted from your compensation.\n\n(d)\nEducation Expenses. The Company will reimburse you for incremental school fees for your children, over and above those fees you would otherwise have incurred in the United States had you not moved to London, estimated to be a maximum of\n£52,000 per year for all of your children.\n\n(e) Home\nLeave/Emergency Leave. For every 12-month period during the term of your assignment the Company will provide you with one round trip business class airline ticket for each member of your immediate family that relocated with you for the\npurposes of home leave to the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jeff Scherb\nSeptember 15, 2005\nPage\n4\n\n\n\nYou will be allowed reasonable time off to attend to personal emergencies, such as death or critical\nillness of a family member.\n\nThe Company will cover the cost\nof transportation in certain situations of personal emergencies, including individual medical crises that require US treatment.\n\n(f) Tax Equalization. It is the Company’s intention to eliminate any difference in tax and social charge liability to which you are subject\nwhile on overseas assignment. To accomplish this you will be “tax equalized” which is specifically designed to:\n\n\n•\t \tProvide that you do not suffer an additional tax/social charge liability or benefit as a result of your being assigned to the London office.\n\n\n\n•\t \tProvide assistance to you to ensure compliance with United States expatriate tax and social charge laws as well as the tax and social charge laws of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nAll UK income taxes will be reimbursed to you or\npaid by the Company on your behalf. There should be no UK social charges (National Insurance) payable. Your base salary and any incentive bonus will be reduced by United States hypothetical withholding. This is an estimated tax and social charge\nliability computed by our tax advisor which includes United States income tax, FICA and Medicare. This approximates the total income tax and social charges you would pay as a United States resident.\n\nThe Contingent Allowance and Car Allowance will be included in the tax\nequalization calculation. Any other differentials, allowances, premiums or similar payments given to you as part of the assignment are not included in the hypothetical tax computation and are provided tax-free to you, unless elsewhere in this\nletter, there is a specific statement that the tax liability is your responsibility.\n\nYour United States compensation will continue to be subject to hypothetical United States withholding, if applicable. Following the annual income tax filing, a reconciliation of your United States hypothetical\nwithholding and hypothetical (final) United States income tax and social charge liability will be computed by our tax advisor, and a copy will be provided to you. There will be either a balance due to you or by you to the Company. Any balance owed\neither by the Company or by you will be paid no later than 30 days after tax equalizations have been approved by the Worldwide Tax Director. Failure to pay within the 30-day period will result in the addition of an administrative fee on the\noutstanding balance. The Company retains the right to withhold overdue tax equalization settlement amounts from other allowances or reimbursements, or from your annual incentive compensation. If you have terminated your employment and do not remit\nthe settlement due to the Company, the Company has the right to pursue collection through available legal means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jeff Scherb\nSeptember 15, 2005\nPage\n5\n\n\n\nStatement of Responsibility. The Company regards personal income tax and social charge\ncompliance as the obligation of all assignees. It is the policy of the Company to fully comply with the income tax and social charge requirements of both the UK and United States. The Company also expects full compliance by you with all applicable\nlocal tax and social charge laws and regulations. You are responsible for providing the Worldwide Tax Director and our tax adviser with complete information on a timely basis to ensure compliance with tax filing requirements.\n\nPenalties and Interest. Compliance with all tax and social charge\nregulations includes timely filing of tax returns, filing final tax returns before departing from the host country, making proper declaration, and providing accurate documentation as required in support of the tax returns. The fact that the Company\nmay reimburse the actual taxes will in no way obviate or lessen your responsibility in this regard. Additional taxes, interest and penalties relating to your failure to submit information and/or file tax returns on a timely basis or to fully\ndisclose all items of income and reportable expenses, will be borne by you. In addition, penalties or interest assessed as a result of personal investments, and disallowance of personal deductions will not be reimbursed by the Company.\n\n\nTax Return Preparation. The Company, in conjunction with our tax\nadvisor and through its Worldwide Tax Director, will provide tax preparation assistance to you to ensure compliance with United States tax laws as well as the laws of the UK. As you are subject to this policy, you are required to use our tax advisor\nfor preparation of your UK and United States tax returns and tax equalization settlements. As the Company is obligated to tax equalize you, upon request, you will grant the Worldwide Tax Director the right to review your individual tax returns in\nthe UK and the United States, if necessary. All costs associated with these services will be borne by the Company and therefore, tax consultation will be limited to that necessary for the preparation of income tax returns. If you wish to engage a\nfirm for personal consultation, the related fees will be at your own expense.\n\nTax Authority Inquiries. Representation before taxing authorities will be reimbursed by the Company if the issues relate to Company earnings associated with the international assignment. All inquiries from\ntaxing authorities should be immediately forwarded to the Worldwide Tax Director.\n\nFiling Elections/Positions. In preparing the actual income tax return, elections will be made and positions taken to minimize the overall tax burden of the Company. You should exercise care and attention to\nminimize your liability for UK and United States taxes in accordance with appropriate tax planning. You must cooperate with the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jeff Scherb\nSeptember 15, 2005\nPage\n6\n\n\n\n\nCompany to ensure that your tax return is filed in such a manner as to produce the lowest possible overall tax permitted by law. To maximize tax-planning\nopportunities, the Company may choose to recharacterize or restructure certain elements of compensation and/or allowances.\n\nCarryover Benefits. If it is established that a foreign tax credit, alternative minimum tax credit, net operating loss, or other carryover\nresulting from international assignment is available, and to the extent that the carryover results in a reduction of taxes in prior or future years, the amount of such reduction must be remitted to the Company. These carryovers may affect\npre-assignment or post-assignment tax years. During these years, the Company may provide tax return preparation assistance through our tax advisor, who will also determine the amount of carryover benefit to be recaptured by the Company.\n\n\nTaxes Covered. Taxes covered by this equalization policy include\nnational tax and social charges imposed on income and gains. They do not include property, estate, inheritance and transfer taxes, value added, sales or other similar taxes or duties not directly related to income.\n\nIn addition, there are situations where the Company will not accept\nliability for actual income tax charges either in the UK or United States. The situations in which the Company will not reimburse actual income taxes are as follows:\n\n\n1.\tIncremental income taxes imposed by the UK on personal investments made in the UK. It is expected that during the assignment, you will continue to maintain financial contacts with\nthe United States. Therefore, the Company will not bear the incremental tax cost resulting from UK-based investments which cause the imposition of higher UK income tax than would have been imposed if no investments were made in the UK;\n\n\n\n\n2.\tUK taxes incurred upon the sale of a residence in the UK;\n\n\n\n3.\tIncremental taxes caused by termination of employment while on assignment. In the event that you terminate employment with the Company while on assignment, the actual tax\nliabilities which the Company will reimburse or otherwise assume will be limited to the lesser of the actual UK taxes incurred until termination or the UK tax that would have been incurred had the assignment been terminated at that time and had you\nrepatriated to the United States.\n\n\n\n4.\t UK and United States taxes resulting from stock option exercises within six months of termination of employment. If you exercise stock options while on assignment\nand terminate employment (whether voluntarily or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jeff Scherb\nSeptember 15, 2005\nPage\n7\n\n\n\n\n\ninvoluntarily) within six months of the exercise, all actual taxes relating to the option exercise are your responsibility and will not be borne by the\nCompany.\n\n\n\nPlease note that equity income is\nspecifically excluded from tax equalization. Therefore, for example, if you choose to exercise stock options or receive restricted stock whilst on assignment, any worldwide taxes generated as a result will be your sole responsibility. Before you\ndecide to exercise any stock options, please be sure to contact Steve Dickinson in Chicago immediately so that he can work to identify all tax implications.\n\n(g) The Company will reimburse you for any tax or social charge liabilities that may arise in respect to the expatriate benefits provided hereunder. The\nCompany will also pay for its tax advisors to complete your annual income tax returns for the period of your secondment.\n\n(h) During your secondment, you may elect to have some or all of your base salary paid in Pounds Sterling, rather than in U.S. Dollars. For administrative\nand financial purposes, an exchange rate of £1 = $1.815 will be fixed for the Term and such payments will be based on this exchange rate. However, should the average exchange rate for 2005 prove to differ from this rate by more than 10% in\neither direction, the 2005 average exchange rate will be applied for 2006.\n\n\n7.\tAssignment After Secondment. If the EMEA restructuring project which you will supervise during your assignment to the London office is deemed successful by the Company, and\nif at the conclusion of that project you do not continue as Chief Technology and Operations Officer, the Company agrees that, at the end of the EMEA restructuring project it will assign you to a mutually agreeable assignment, the terms of which will\nbe negotiated at that time except that (i) it is understood that the new assignment and compensation package will be significantly smaller than that contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) such new assignment will be offered through 2008, subject to\nthe termination of employment provisions set forth herein. Should you resign your employment or be terminated for cause as that term is described herein, the commitment set forth in this section shall be null and void.\n\n\n\n8.\tCompliance with Policies. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the Term, you agree that you will comply in all material respects with all policies and procedures\napplicable to similarly situated employees of the Company, generally and specifically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jeff Scherb\nSeptember 15, 2005\nPage\n8\n\n\n\n\n9.\tTermination of Employment.\n\n\n(a) Employment At Will. You will be an “employee at will” of the Company, meaning that either party may terminate the employment\nrelationship at any time for any reason (with or without cause or reason) upon written notice to the other party. A period of notice shall only be required if it is expressly provided in writing under written Company employment policies in effect at\nthe time of such termination.\n\n(b) No Notice Period in Case\nof Termination for Cause. Notwithstanding Section 8(a) the Company shall have the right to terminate your employment for cause immediately upon written notice. For purposes of this Agreement, “cause” shall mean any of the following:\n(i) your engagement, during the performance of your duties hereunder, in acts or omissions constituting dishonesty, fraud, intentional breach of fiduciary obligation or intentional wrongdoing or malfeasance; (ii) your conviction for a felony; (iii)\nyour violation or breach of any provision of this Agreement; (iv) your unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information pertaining to the Company’s business; (v) your engagement in conduct causing demonstrable injury to the Company or\nits reputation; (vi) your unreasonable failure or refusal to perform your duties as the Company reasonably requires, to meet goals reasonably established by the Company, or to abide by the Company’s policies for the operation of its business,\nand the continuation thereof after the receipt by you of written notice from the Company; (vii) your illegal use of drugs or use of alcohol or intoxication on work premises, during working time, or which interferes with the performance of your\nduties and obligations on behalf of the Company; or (viii) your death.\n\n(c) Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination. Upon the termination of your employment, you will be paid your Base Salary and Management Salary up through your last day of work (the “Termination Date”), and any other\namounts required by law. In the event that you terminate your employment or in the event that the Company terminates your employment for cause as defined in this Agreement, you will not be entitled to any of the benefits contemplated herein to\nextend beyond your employment, unless otherwise provided by relevant plan documents. In addition, if you terminate your employment or if the Company terminates your employment for cause you will not be eligible for moving expenses for which you\nmight otherwise have been eligible, except that, in the case of your death, the Company will pay moving expenses to return your immediate family to the United States.\n\n(d) Return of Materials. Upon the termination of your employment, you agree to return to the Company, all Company\nproperty, including all materials furnished to you during your employment (including but not limited to keys, computers, automobiles, electronic communication devices, files and identification cards) and all materials created by you during your\nemployment. In addition, you agree that upon the termination of your\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jeff Scherb\nSeptember 15, 2005\nPage\n9\n\n\n\n\nemployment you will provide the Company with all passwords and similar information which will be necessary for the Company to access materials on which you\nworked or to otherwise continue in its business.\n\n\n10.\tConfidentiality. In the course of your employment with the Company you will be given access to and otherwise obtain knowledge of certain trade secrets and confidential and\nproprietary information pertaining to the business of the Company and its affiliates. During the term of your employment with the Company and thereafter, you will not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Company,\ndisclose or use for the benefit of any person, corporation or other entity, or for yourself, any trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information concerning the Company or its affiliates, including, but not limited to, information\npertaining to their clients, services, products, earnings, finances, operations, marketing, methods or other activities; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to information which is of public record or is generally known, disclosed\nor available to the general public or the industry generally (other than as a result of your breach of this covenant or the breach by another employee of his or her confidentiality obligations). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose such\ninformation as is required by law during any legal proceeding or to your personal representatives and professional advisers as is required for purposes of rendering tax or legal advice, and, with respect to such personal representatives and\nprofessional advisers, you shall inform them of your obligations hereunder and take all reasonable steps to ensure that such professional advisers do not disclose the existence or substance thereof. Further, you shall not, directly or indirectly,\nremove or retain, and upon termination of employment for any reason you shall return to the Company, any records, computer disks or files, computer printouts, business plans or any copies or reproductions thereof, or any information or instruments\nderived therefrom, arising out of or relating to the business of the Company and its affiliates or obtained as a result of your employment by the Company.\n\n\n\n11.\t Non-Solicitation/Non-Competition. Without the prior written consent of the Company, during the term of your employment with the Company and for a period of\nsix-months after the termination of your employment with the Company, you shall not (i) become engaged in or otherwise become interested in, whether as an owner, officer, employee, consultant, director, stockholder, or otherwise, any company,\nenterprise or entity that provides or intends to provide services similar to those provided by the Company in the geographical area which you served during your employment with the Company; (ii) directly or indirectly solicit or assist any other\nperson in soliciting any client of the Company with whom you had contact during your employment with the Company, about which you learned confidential information during your employment with the Company, or whose account you oversaw during your\nemployment with the Company or (iii) directly or indirectly solicit or hire, or assist any other person in soliciting or hiring, any employee of the Company or its affiliates (as of your termination of employment with the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jeff Scherb\nSeptember 15, 2005\nPage\n10\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany) or any person who, as of such date, was in the process of being recruited by the Company or its affiliates, or induce any such employee to terminate\nhis or her employment with the Company or its affiliates. The provisions of this Section 11 shall be in addition to any restrictive covenants that are set forth in or otherwise required by Company benefit plans, including but not limited to the\nChange in Control Severance Plan and the Severance Pay Plan. In the case of a discrepancy between this Section and any such restrictive covenant, the more restrictive language will apply.\n\n\n\n\n12.\tOther Legal Matters.\n\n\n(a) No Other Agreements/Obligations. You have advised the Company that your execution and performance of the terms of this Agreement do not and\nwill not violate any other agreement binding on you or the rights of any third parties and you understand that in the event this advice is not accurate the Company will not have any obligation to you under this Agreement.\n\n(b) United States Employment. You will be an employee of the\nCompany’s United States operations and agree that your employment with the Company shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of Illinois.\n\n(c) Arbitration.

Arbitration shall be the parties’ exclusive remedy for any such controversies, claims or breaches. The parties also consent to\npersonal jurisdiction in Chicago, Illinois with respect to such arbitration. The award resulting from such arbitration shall be final and binding upon both parties. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the\nState of Illinois without regard to any conflict of law provisions of any jurisdiction. You and the Company hereby waive the right to pursue any claims, including but not limited to employment termination - related claims, through civil litigation\noutside the arbitration procedures of this provision, unless otherwise required by law.

The Executive shall be entitled to receive from the Company retiree medical coverage substantially identical to coverage in effect for senior\nexecutive officers at MONY Life, consistent with the terms of such coverage and such changes as may from time to time be made in accordance with MONY Life’s practices.

The Period of Employment may be terminated by the Company if the Executive shall be rendered incapable of performing his duties to the Company by reason of\nany medically determined physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that can be expected to last for a period of either (i) six or more consecutive months from the first date of the Executive’s absence due to the\ndisability or (ii) nine months during any twelve-month period (a “Disability”).\n\n\n\n(D)\t \tTermination Procedure; Arbitration\n\n\n\n(1)\t \tNotice.

A lump-sum payment in an amount equal to the Executive’s then current base compensation and then current bonus amount for the greater of (i) a one-year\nperiod or (ii) the period ending on the Expiration Date (the “Severance Period”). For purposes hereof, the Executive’s then current bonus amount shall be based upon a 3-year average bonus (or such shorter applicable period) commencing\nwith the Executive’s MIP bonus for the fiscal\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear of the Company ending in 2000 and assuming an annual bonus for the applicable averaging period of at least $400,000.\n\n\n\n\n(2)\t \tMerger MIP. A lump-sum payment in an amount equal to the highest amount which the Executive is eligible to receive pursuant to the Merger MIP.\n\n\n\n\n(3)\t \tEquity Awards. All outstanding equity awards shall fully and immediately vest and all restrictions shall lapse, and such awards shall be exercisable for a period equal\nto the later of one year or the Expiration Date (or any such later period provided for in the applicable equity award agreement), subject to the terms of the applicable plan.\n\n\n\n(4)\t \tPerquisites. The Executive shall continue to receive, for the Severance Period, the perquisites to which the Executive is entitled under 5(D) above immediately before\nthe Termination Date and such other items (such as personal computers) as the Chief Executive Officer of MONY shall determine. The Company shall provide the reasonable cost of shipping personal files and other personal property of the Executive to\nthe location designated by the Executive.\n\n\n\n(5)\t \tSplit Dollar Policy. The Company shall keep in effect, for the life of the Executive, the split-dollar life insurance policy maintained for the Executive immediately\nprior to the Termination Date. The Company and the Executive shall retain their respective obligations to pay premiums in accordance with the terms of the policy.\n\n\n\n(B)\t \tTermination by the Company for Cause or by the Executive Other Than for Good Reason. In the event of a termination by the Company of the Executive’s employment\nfor Cause or by the Executive other than for Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled only to the compensation and benefits required by law upon termination of employment and the benefits otherwise due to the Executive under the applicable plans\nand programs of the Company, and the benefits under Sections 5(F) and (G) of this Agreement and under Section 8(A)(5) of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n(C)\t \tTime of Payment. All lump-sum payments to be made by the Company under this Section 8 shall be made within five days after the Termination Date.\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.\t \tADDITIONAL PAYMENTS\n\n\n\n(A)\t \tGross-Up Payment. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, if it shall be determined that any amount paid, distributed\nor treated as paid or distributed by the Company or any of its affiliates to or for Executive’s benefit (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard\nto any additional payments required under this Section 9) (a “Payment”) would be subject the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or any interest or penalties are\nincurred by Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Excise Tax”), then Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional\npayment (a “Gross-Up Payment”) in an amount such that after payment by Executive of all federal, state and local taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income\ntaxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.\n\n\nAll determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including\nwhether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm as may be designated by Executive\n(the “Accounting Firm”) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is\nrequested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change in control, Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make\nthe determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to\nthis Section 9, shall be paid by the Company to Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm’s determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive. As a result of the\nuncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made\n(“Underpayment”), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 9(B) and Executive thereafter is required to make a\npayment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for Executive’s benefit.\n\n\n(B)\t \tNotification of Claims. Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by\nthe Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but not later than ten business after Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date\non which such claim is requested to be paid. Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment\nof taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, Executive shall:\n\n\n\n(i)\t \tgive the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,\n\n\n(ii)\t \ttake such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal\nrepresentation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,\n\n\n(iii)\t \tcooperate with the Company in good faith in order to effectively contest such claim, and\n\n\n(iv)\t \tpermit the Company to participate in any proceeding relating to such claim;\n\n\n\nprovided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties)\nincurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and\npayment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on foregoing provisions of this Section 9, the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative\nappeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and\nExecutive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided,\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhowever, that if the Company directs Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall\nadvance the amount of such payment to Executive, on an interest-free basis, and shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with\nrespect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for Executive’s taxable year with respect to which\nsuch contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company’s control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and\nExecutive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.\n\n\n(C)\t \tRefund of Claims. If, after Executive’s receipt of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(B), Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund\nwith respect to such claim, Executive shall (subject to the Company’s complying with the requirements of Section 9(B)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes\napplicable thereto). If, after Executive’s receipt of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(B)), a determination is made that Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not\nnotify Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall\noffset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.\n\n\n\n10.\t \tWITHHOLDING\n\n\nAll payments shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax, excise tax, and other payroll deductions as the Company may\ndetermine it should withhold.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.\t \tINDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE; LEGAL EXPENSES\n\n\n\n(A)\t \tIndemnification and Insurance. The Company will indemnify the Executive (including payment of expenses in advance of final disposition of the proceeding) to the\nfullest extent permitted by law and the Charter and By-Laws of the Company; and the Executive shall be entitled to the protection of any insurance policies the Company may elect to maintain for the benefit of its directors and officers, against all\ncosts, charges, and expenses whatsoever incurred by him in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding to which he may be made a party by reason of his being or having been a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries or affiliates or his serving or having served any other enterprise as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company.\n\n\n\n\n(B)\t \tLegal Expenses. In the event of any arbitration (or other action under Section 4(C)) between the Company and the Executive with respect to the subject matter of this\nAgreement, the Company shall reimburse the Executive, should the Executive prevail in any respect, for all of his reasonable costs and expenses relating to such arbitration including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses.\nIn no event shall the Executive be required to reimburse the Company for any of the costs or expenses relating to such arbitration.\n\n\n\n12.\t \tNOTICES\n\n\nAll notices and other communications shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given when mailed in the continental United States by registered or\ncertified mail or personally delivered to the party entitled thereto at the address stated below or to such changed address as the addressee may have given by a similar notice:\n\n\nTo the Company:\nTo the Executive:\n\nc/o The Advest Group, Inc.\nGrant W.

This Agreement shall not confer any right or impose any obligation on the Executive to continue in the employ of the Company or MONY, or limit the right of\nthe Company, MONY or the Executive to terminate his employment.\n\n\n\n(B)\t \tAssignment of Interest.

In light of that, E-LOAN agrees to pay for the following\nrelocation expenses:\n\nAssignment of a relocation counselor\n\nRelocation of household goods\n\nRelocation of vehicles owned by you, your spouse-partner, children\n\nOne month temporary housing and living expenses\n\nOne month car rental\n\nReimbursement for non-deductible closing costs on the purchase of a\nCalifornia home, not to exceed the value of 1 point of the mortgage amount.\n\nUp to $15,000 reimbursement for closing costs associated with the sale of\nyour New York residence.\n\nTwo house-hunting trips for a duration of three days each for you and your\nspouse/partner\n\nYour move-out travel flight for you, your spouse-partner, children\n\nIf you should choose to resign from E-LOAN prior to completing one year with\nE-LOAN, all relocation expenses incurred by E-LOAN on your behalf must be repaid\nto E-LOAN by you on a pro-rata basis. Likewise, if E-LOAN should terminate your\nemployment \"Without Cause\" within one year, the Company will pay for\nyour relocation back to East Coast.\n\nTerm of Employment\n\nYou agree to remain employed for a period of eighteen (18) months after\nthe Closing Date.  Nevertheless, E-LOAN may terminate your employment at any\ntime for any reason, with or without cause, by giving you written notice of such\ntermination.\n\nIf E-LOAN terminates your employment \"Without Cause\" prior to\neighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, then E-LOAN will continue your base\nsalary as a severance payment until the earlier of six (6) months after the date\nof the termination of your employment or the date you begin employment or\nconsulting with another employer.  You will notify E-LOAN in writing within ten\ndays of your acceptance of any new employment.  The severance set forth herein\nwill be in lieu of any entitlement you may have to notice of termination, pay in\nlieu of notice of termination, or any other severance payment from any other\nsource.  All benefits and future stock and option vesting would terminate as of\nthe date of termination of your employment.  You would, of course, be paid your\nsalary through your date of termination and for the value of all unused paid\ntime off earned through that date and allowed to continue your medical coverage\nat your own expense to the extent provided for by COBRA, but you would not be\nentitled to any additional payments or benefits except as set forth herein.  You\nwould be allowed to exercise your vested options during the time period set\nforth in and in accordance with your option agreement.\n\nIf your employment were to be terminated for \"Cause\" within\neighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, then you would be paid all salary\nand benefits, as well as for the value of your unused paid time off, through the\ndate of termination of your employment, but nothing else.  A termination for\n\"Cause\" shall mean a termination for any of the following reasons:\n(i) your failure to perform the duties of your position after receipt of a\nwritten warning; (ii) engaging in misconduct ; (iii) being convicted of a\nfelony; (iv) committing an act of fraud against, or the misappropriation of\nproperty belonging to, E-LOAN; or (v) material breach of this agreement or any\nconfidentiality or proprietary information agreement between you and E-LOAN.  E-\nLOAN will provide written notice of the reason for termination in the case of\nany termination for \"Cause.\"  A termination for any other reason shall\nbe a termination \"Without Cause.\"\n\nIf your employment with E-LOAN were to continue after eighteen (18) months\nbeyond the Closing Date, then your employment would continue to be on an\n\"at-will\" basis.  This means that either you or E-LOAN could terminate\nyour employment at any time for any reason with or without cause and without the\nobligation to pay you, or your right to, any severance payment except as may be\nprovided at such time under E-LOAN's employee benefit plans for which you are\neligible.\n\nYour Position\n\nYou will initially have the title of Senior Vice President, Auto\nOperations, reporting to myself and Janina Pawlowski.

Such written approval will\nnot be unreasonably withheld if such outside employment, business or activity\nwould not in any way be competitive with the business or proposed business of E-\nLOAN or otherwise conflict with or adversely affect in any way your performance\nof your employment obligations to E-LOAN.\n\nCommencing on the Closing Date and continuing until the later of eighteen\n(18) months after the closing date or one (1) year after the date of termination\nof your employment, you will not, as an employee, agent, consultant, advisor,\nindependent contractor, general partner, officer, director, stockholder,\ninvestor, lender or guarantor of any corporation, partnership or other entity,\nor in any other capacity directly or indirectly:\n\n\n\nEngage in any business which provides to users of the Internet services\nwhich relate to first or second home mortgage loans, consumer credit and other\nloan-related services, including the ability to search for, compare, lock-in,\nand apply for loans (the \"Business\");  or\ninduce or attempt to induce any person who at the time of such inducement is\nan employee of E-LOAN to perform work or services for any other person or entity\nother than E-LOAN; or\npermit your name to be used in connection with a business which is\ncompetitive or substantially similar to the Business.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you may own, directly or indirectly, solely as\nan investment, up to one percent (1%) of any class of \"publicly traded\nsecurities\" of any person or entity which owns a business that is\ncompetitive or substantially similar to the Business.

Any claims asserted by you against E-LOAN shall not\nconstitute a defense in any injunction action brought by E-LOAN to obtain\nspecific enforcement of said paragraphs.\n\nArbitration\n\nWe each agree that any and all disputes between us which arise out of\nyour employment, the termination of your employment, or under the terms of this\nagreement shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration.

You understand and agree that arbitration shall be instead of any\ncivil litigation, that each side waives its right to a jury trial, and that the\narbitrator's decision shall be final and binding to the fullest extent permitted\nby law and enforceable by any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\nMiscellaneous Provisions\n\nThis agreement and the accompanying Proprietary Information and\nInventions Agreement will be the entire agreement between E-LOAN and you\nrelating to your employment and the additional matters provided for herein.

{"content": "Employment Agreement between Intermix Media, Inc. and Lisa Terrill\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.1\n\nMarch 17, 2005\n\nPRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL\n\nMs. Lisa M. Terrill\n214 15th Place\nManhattan Beach, CA 90266\n\nDear Lisa,\n\nOn behalf of Intermix Media, Inc. (“Intermix” or the “Company”), I am delighted to summarize the terms and conditions of\nan offer of employment with the Company. Upon your acceptance, these terms will be incorporated in a comprehensive employment agreement for execution by both parties. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Andy Knox with any questions or comments\nthat you may have on the content of this document or our intentions, as well as any related issues.\n\n\nI.\tRole and Reporting Relationship\n\n\nYou will join the Company as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and report directly to me in my capacity as Chief Executive Officer. In\naddition to your role as the Company’s senior financial executive, you will also oversee human resources, be an executive officer of the Company and participate with the Company’s other executive officers and senior management in setting\nand executing company policy and direction.\n\n\nII.\tCompensation and Benefits\n\n\nWe have customized components of the Company’s compensation and benefits programs to suit your particular needs. You will be eligible to participate\nin all of the programs available to executive officers at Intermix, subject, of course, to the terms and conditions of those programs and the Company’s policies with respect to their implementation. Please keep in mind that a cornerstone of our\ncompensation philosophy is the link between executive compensation and corporate performance and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs. Lisa M. Terrill\t \tMarch 17, 2005\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\nreturns to\nstockholders. Your compensation and benefits will include the items summarized below:\n\n\n•\t \tBase Annual Salary - $225,000 initially. Your performance will be reviewed annually along with that of the senior executives of the Company generally. Adjustments to your\nbase salary, if any, will be made at that time.\n\n\n\n•\t \tPerformance Bonus - you will participate in the annual incentive program of Intermix as established from year to year upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of\nthe Company’s Board of Directors. For fiscal year 2005 (ending March 31, 2005), executive officers are eligible to earn awards in the range of zero to sixty percent (60%) of their base salary based upon achievement of Company performance\nmetrics. The target award under the Program is thirty percent (30%) of base salary, based upon achievement of 100% of the performance criteria, which amount may increase or decrease based upon exceeding or falling short of such targets.\n\n\n\n\n•\t \tEquity - is a very important component of the compensation philosophy of Intermix Media. The Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has adopted a\nLong-Term Equity Compensation Plan (“LTECP”) with respect to the administration of the Company’s 2004 Stock Awards Plan. Under the LTECP, stock - awards to executive officers are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee,\nsubject to Board approval. I will recommend to the Compensation Committee that, at the earliest possible opportunity, you be granted an option to purchase 300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock which option would vest over 4 years with\n25% of the option vesting one year after the date of grant and the pro-rata remainder vesting quarterly thereafter. The strike price of the option will be market price as of the date of grant. The Company is presently working with Mercer to\nreevaluate the LTECP and to establish guidelines for the award of restricted stock or restricted stock units. We expect that you will play a role in this process given your finance and human resources responsibilities, working closely with Jim\nQuandt, Chair of the Compensation Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs. Lisa M. Terrill\t \tMarch 17, 2005\nPage 3 of 4\n\n\n\n•\t \tOther - the full range of benefits for you and the family will be summarized separately in our Employee Benefits Handbook. Of particular interest to you may be our\n401(k) Program. Employees are provided the opportunity to make contributions of up to fifteen percent (15%) of their base salary to the Program, with limitations as determined by applicable statute. The Company fully matches the first three percent\n(3%) of an employee’s contributions and then one half of the next two percent (2%). Employees are eligible to participate in this Program after ninety (90) days of continuous employment.\n\n\n\nIII.\tSeverance and Notice\n\n\nIntermix is an “at will” employer. You will be provided with up to six (6) months of base salary and benefits continuation (the latter to be\nprovided in the form of Company-paid COBRA) as severance in the event that you are terminated for reasons other than cause during the term of your employment. This benefit would be payable monthly for up to six (6) months or until you begin new\nemployment, whichever occurs first.\n\nBoth parties will be\nrequired to provide the other with thirty (30) days of written notice of their intention to terminate the relationship.\n\n\nIV.\tReference Checking and Background Check\n\n\nThis offer is contingent upon satisfactory personal and professional reference checking, as well as a comprehensive background check, which will be\nconducted on our behalf by Korn/Ferry International.\n\n*************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs. Lisa M. Terrill\t \tMarch 17, 2005\nPage 4 of 4\n\n\nThank you for all of the time, thought\nand effort that you have invested in considering Intermix and the Chief Financial Officer role. We are all very pleased by the prospect of your playing a leading role in the future of Intermix. On a personal and professional note, I am looking\nforward to partnering together to lead Intermix and maximize its full potential in the years to come. If you accept our offer on the terms and conditions set forth above, please kindly sign and return a duplicate to me or Andy Knox no later than\nthe close of business on March 21, 2005.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ Brett Brewer\n\nBrett Brewer\nPresident and Director\nIntermix Media, Inc.\n\nAccepted:\n\n\n\n/s/ Lisa M.

If Mr. Jankovic is terminated without cause (with one month advance notice of termination without cause), then, in exchange for a mutual general release, the Company will pay healthcare coverage for one year, unvested options granted in 2003 would be accelerated and all vested options would be exercisable for five years after termination of employment.

In the event employment is terminated as a result of a merger or consolidation as described above, or as a result of a lender, major investor or acquirer establishing a new board of directors which institutes such termination, Employee shall receive as compensation a lump-sum payment equal to two year's salary at Employee's then-current rate plus a severance payment of $300,000.00.

Employee agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months from voluntary termination of employment with IMS, Employee will not engage in or otherwise affiliate with any barter or trade exchange located within a fifty (50) mile radius of any IMS office, nor with any other business operation directly or indirectly related to, or in competition with, the business operation of IMS, nor shall he use any knowledge, trade secrets, client lists or other information developed during the term of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nLiability and Indemnification\n\n\n\n\n\nIMS' bylaws provide for the elimination, to the fullest extent permissible under Wisconsin law, of the liability of its officers and directors to the Company for monetary damages. This limitation of liability does not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief. The Company's bylaws also provide that IMS shall indemnify its directors and officers against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status for service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from certain specified misconduct. IMS is required to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them for which they could be indemnified, including in circumstances in which indemnification is otherwise discretionary under Wisconsin law. At the present time, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Company in which indemnification would be required or permitted. IMS is not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding which may result in a claim for such indemnification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nContract Interpretation and Enforcement.

It is understood that International Monetary Systems, Ltd. has an operating subsidiary named Continental Trade Exchange, Ltd., (CTE) that is the actual employer of record with all governmental agencies. Therefore, both IMS and CTE are responsible for fulfilling all of Company's responsibilities under this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Company believes it to be in the best interests of IMS and its shareholders that the services of Employee be retained under the terms provided in this Agreement; and\n\n\n\n\n\nWHEREAS, Employee is willing to be employed by IMS under the terms provided in this Agreement; and\n\n\n\n\n\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants hereinafter contained, it is agreed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nPurpose of Agreement. Commencing with the date of this Agreement, IMS agrees to employ Employee, and Employee agrees to work for IMS under the terms and conditions contained herein. The Employee agrees to devote his full time and best efforts to the business of IMS and the performance of his duties hereunder and to perform such duties as are assigned to him in a competent and workmanlike manner and will do nothing by either word or deed to harm the reputation of IMS in the marketplace. The Employee shall be subject to the supervision and direction of the president, CEO and directors of IMS as to assignment and performance of his duties and agrees to perform such duties as may be assigned to him from time to time by the president, CEO and directors of IMS.

In the event a new board of directors, or an outside party attaining a majority of the board assumes control of IMS or CTE and substantially reduces Employee's authority or role in the Company, he will immediately receive a lump-sum payment of $400,000.00. In the event employment is terminated as a result of a merger or consolidation as described above, or as a result of a lender, major investor or acquirer establishing a new board of directors which institutes such termination, Employee shall receive as compensation a lump-sum payment equal to two year's salary at Employee's then-current rate plus a severance payment of $300,000.00.

This limitation of liability does not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief. The Company's bylaws also provide that 1MS shall indemnify its directors and officers against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status for service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from certain specified misconduct.

Each bonus earned\nby Perik shall be paid to him within\n21/2 months\nfollowing the end of the calendar year in which the bonus was\nearned.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Perik shall be\nemployed at will, and either party may terminate Perik’s\nemployment with or without Cause at any time. Accordingly,\nPerik’s employment may be terminated during a Term by Perik\nvoluntarily or by TPR with or without Cause in accordance with\nthe Policy Statement.\n\n\n6.\nSeverance:  In the event that Perik’s\nemployment is terminated by TPR without Cause or Perik\nterminates his employment due to a material and sustained\ndiminution in his authority, duties, and responsibilities, then\nin addition to the payments under Section 5.1 of the Policy\nStatement and in lieu of the payments provided under\nSections 5.3 and 5.4 of the Policy Statement (which\nSections shall not apply to Perik in any event), TPR will pay\nPerik a severance payment of $500,000, or, if such termination\nby TPR without Cause occurs within\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na12 months after a Change of Control, such severance\npayment shall be $1,000,000.

than 90 days after termination (and in no event later than the expiration of the Options).  In the event of Employee’s termination due to his death or Disability, vested Options may be exercised after termination but in no event later than 180 days after death or Disability (and in no event later than the expiration of the Options).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe terms set forth in this paragraph 4(d) and all other terms governing the Options shall be set forth in a separate Stock Option Agreement between the Company and the Employee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.           Participation in Benefit Plans; Office

terms and conditions of such benefit plans and programs as they may be modified by the Company from time to time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company will provide the Employee with office and clerical support appropriate to his position, including a private office, an administrative assistant and parking privileges.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employee will not be entitled to any automobile allowance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.           Termination.  (a) The Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and the Employee’s employment prior to the expiration of the Term only for “Cause” (as defined below).  The Company shall have no obligations to the Employee for any period subsequent to the effective date of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph 6(a), except any and all obligations provided by law and the payment of Base Salary (pursuant to paragraph 4(a)) up to and including the termination date, bonus earned and approved by the Committee (pursuant to paragraph 4(b)), reimbursement of expenses\nincurred prior to the termination date (pursuant to paragraph 4(c)), and benefits accrued prior to the termination date (pursuant to paragraph 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)           If, prior to the end of the Term, the Company terminates this Agreement and the Employee's employment for any reason other than for Cause or if the Employee resigns for Good Reason (as defined below), the Employee shall be entitled to receive the amounts payable under paragraph 6(a), plus the amount of his Base Salary that would have been paid for the remainder of the Term (collectively referred to herein as “Severance”).   Subject to paragraph 6(f) below, the Severance shall be paid in equal monthly installments, as of the first of each month, beginning with the month following sixty (60) days after such termination provided that the first of such payments would include any amounts that would have been payable absent the 60-day delay in comme\nncement date, and such payments shall continue for the duration of the Term (which payment period is referred to herein as the “Severance Period”).  During the Severance Period, the Employee shall have a duty to seek other employment, but shall not be required to accept any position other than a position (i) as a senior executive officer with the same general responsibilities that the Employee possessed at the Company at the time of commencement of this Agreement, and (ii) with a company equal or larger in earnings and tangible net worth than the Company at the time of the Employee's termination.  The Employee may, however, accept any full-time position at any level and at any salary with any entity, profit or non-profit, and the Employee, by accepting such employment, shall be conclusively deemed to have fulfilled his duty to seek employment under this paragraph 6(b).  The Company shall be entitled to redu\nce the amounts paid under this paragraph 6(b) by the amounts paid to the Employee in the same period by such other entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)           If, prior to the end of the Term, the Company terminates this Agreement and the Employee’s employment for any reason other than for Cause or if the Employee resigns for Good Reason, in each event within two years after a Change in Control (as defined in the EIP), in lieu of the amount payable under paragraph 6(b), Employee will receive a lump sum payment equal to the sum of his then Base Salary and Target Bonus amount,  multiplied by the greater of (i) two, or (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months remaining in the Term, and the denominator of which is twelve; provided, however, that such payment shall be limited to an amount which would not result in an “excess parachute payment” as that term is defined in Internal R\nevenue Code section 280G.  Subject to paragraph 6(f) below, payment of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe amount due under this paragraph 6(c) shall be made as soon as practicable after the termination occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)           For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means any of the following:  (i) the Employee’s conviction of or plea of nolo contendere to a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude, (ii) the Employee’s material breach of a material provision of this Agreement that is not corrected within thirty (30) days following written notice of such breach sent by the Company to the Employee, (iii) the Employee’s willful misconduct in the performance of his material duties under this Agreement, (iv) the Employee’s performance of his materi\nal duties in a manner that is grossly negligent, and (v) the Employee’s failure to attempt to fully comply with any lawful directive of the Board which is not corrected within thirty (30) days following written notice of such breach sent by the Company to the Employee.  Whether or not “Cause” exists shall be determined solely by the Company in its reasonable, good faith discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)           For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason”  means, without the Employee's written consent,  (i) a material and substantially adverse reduction in title or job responsibilities compared with title or job responsibilities on the Effective Date, but shall not include a change of title and position during the Term to only Chief Executive Officer, (ii) any requirement that the Employee relocate to a work location more than 50 miles from the metropolitan Los Angeles area; or (iii) any material breach of the Agreement by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Good Reason will be deemed to exist only in the event that: (x) the Employee gives written notice to the Company of his claim of Good Reason and the specific grounds for his claim\nwithin ninety (90) days following the occurrence of the event upon which his claim rests, (y) the Company fails to cure such breach within thirty days (30) of receiving such notice (“Cure Period”), and (z) the Employee gives written notice to the Company to terminate his employment within fifteen (15) days following the Cure Period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Employee is a “specified employee” (as such term is defined in Section 409A) and the provisions of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(2) apply because payments due under this Agreement constitute deferred compensation for purposes of Code Section 409A, payments under this paragraph 6 shall in no event be made prior to six months after the Participant’s separation from service (the “Suspension Period”).  All payments suspended during the Suspension Period will be paid in a lump sum and the normal payment schedule will resume at the end of the Suspension Period.  Each of the affected payments under this paragraph (f) shall be a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Employee shall not be entitled to Severance or Change in Control payments under this paragraph 6 unless (i) the Employee materially complies with the restrictive covenants by which he is bound (whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise), including, but not limited to, any non-competition agreement, non-solicitation agreement, confidentiality agreement or invention assignment agreement signed by the Employee, and (ii) the Employee executes, delivers and does not revoke a commercially reasonable general release in form and substance acceptable to both the Company and Employee no later than sixty (60) days following the effective date of termination of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.           Death or Disability.  Upon the death or Disability (as defined below) of the Employee prior to the end of the Term, this Agreement shall terminate and no further payments shall be made other than those provided for by law and the payment of Base Salary (pursuant to paragraph 4(a)) up to and including the termination date, bonus earned and approved by the Committee (pursuant to paragraph 4(b)), reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to such termination (pursuant to paragraph 4(c)), and benefits (pursuant to paragraph 5) accrued prior to the date of such death or Disability but not yet paid.  For purposes of this parag\nraph 7, Disability shall mean any physical or mental incapacity that is documented by qualified medical experts and that results in the Employee’s inability to perform his essential material duties and responsibilities for the Company, with reasonable accommodation, for a period of ninety (90) days in any consecutive twelve (12) month period, all as determined in the good faith judgment of the Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.           Restrictive Covenants.  The Employee hereby covenants, agrees and acknowledges as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)           Confidential Information.  In the course of his employment by the Company, the Employee will receive and/or be in possession of confidential information of the

developments; and (iii) other tangible and intangible property that is used in the operations of the Company but not made public.&\n#160; The information and trade secrets relating to the business of the Company described in this paragraph 8(a) are hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Confidential Information,” provided that the term Confidential Information will not include any information: (x) that is or becomes generally publicly available (other than as a result of violation of this Agreement by the Employee or someone under his control or direction or (y) that the Employee receives on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than the Company or its representatives) that is not known by him to be bound by an obligation of secrecy or confidentiality to the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)           Non-Disclosure.  The Employee agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, during the period of his employment or at any time thereafter, disclose or make use of any such Confidential Information, except as may be required by law (and, in such case, he will immediately notify the Company of such disclosure request) or in the course of his employment hereunder.  The Employee agrees that all tangible materials containing Confidential Information, whether created by the Employee or others, that comes into his custody or possession during his employment, will be and are the exclusive property of the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)           Return of Confidential Information and Property.  Upon termination of the Employee’s employment for any reason whatsoever, he will immediately surrender to the Company all Confidential Information and property of the Company in his possession, custody or control in whatever form maintained (including, without limitation, computer discs and other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nelectronic media), including all copies thereof.  Employee shall be allowed to make and keep a copy of all personal information, including, but not limited to, personal information contained in his contacts directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)           Non-Competition.  The Employee agrees that, while employed by the Company and for one year after the cessation of his employment with the Company for any reason other than a termination pursuant to paragraph 6(b) or 6(c), he will not become employed by or otherwise engage in or carry on, whether directly or indirectly as a principal, agent, consultant, partner or otherwise, any business with any person, partnership, business, corporation, company or other entity (or any affiliate, subsidiary, parent or division thereof) that is in direct competition with the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)           Non-Solicitation/No-Hiring.  The Employee agrees that, while employed by the Company and for the greater of one year after the cessation of his employment with the Company for any reason or the period during which the Employee receives Severance or Change in Control payments, he will not (i) solicit or induce or attempt to solicit or induce any employee, director or consultant to terminate his or her employment or other engagement with the Company or (ii) employ or retain (or in any way assist, participate in or arrange for the

non-solicitation/no-hiring provisions are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, and that they will be materially and irrevocably damaged if these provisions are not specifically enforced.  Accordingly, the Employee agrees that, in addition to any other relief or remedies available to the Company and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, the Company will be entitled to seek an appropriate injunctive or other equitable remedy for the purposes of restraining Empl\noyee from any actual or threatened breach of those provisions, and no bond or security will be required in connection therewith.  If any of the foregoing confidentiality, non-competition and no-solicitation/no-hiring

ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.           Effect of Prior Agreements.  This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements between the Company and the Employee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.           Notices.  All notices that are required or may be given pursuant to the terms of this

The Company shall not, however, by reason of this paragraph be obligated to institute, maintain, or refrain from changing, amending, or discontinuing, any such benefit plan or program, so\nlong as such changes are similarly applicable to employees generally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 4: EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ON COMPENSATION; ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS\n4.1 Defined Terms. For purposes of this Article 4, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:\n“Base Amount” shall be the “base amount” of Key Employee’s annual compensation, determined in accordance with\nSection 280(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n“Change in Control” means (i) a merger\nof the Company with another entity, a consolidation involving the Company, or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to another entity if, in any such case, (A) the holders of equity securities of the Company\nimmediately prior to such transaction or event do not beneficially own immediately after such transaction or event equity securities of the resulting entity entitled to 40% or more of the votes then eligible to be cast in the election of directors\ngenerally (or comparable governing body) of the resulting entity in substantially the same proportions that they owned the equity securities of the Company immediately prior to such transaction or event or (B) the persons who were members of\nthe Board of Directors immediately prior to such transaction or event shall not constitute at least a majority of the board of directors of the resulting entity immediately after such transaction or event, (ii) the dissolution or liquidation of\nCompany, (iii) when any person or entity, including a “group” as contemplated by Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, acquires or gains ownership or control (including, without limitation, power to\nvote) of more than 60% of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of, (A) if the Company has not engaged in a merger or consolidation, Company, or (B) if the Company has engaged in a merger or consolidation, the resulting\nentity, or (iv) as a result of or in connection with a contested election of directors, the persons who were members of the Board of Directors immediately before such election shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors. For\npurposes of the preceding sentence, (1) “resulting entity” in the context of a transaction or event that is a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets shall mean the surviving entity (or acquiring entity in the\ncase of an asset sale) unless the surviving entity (or acquiring entity in the case of an asset sale) is a subsidiary of another entity and the holders of common stock of the Company receive capital stock of such other entity in such transaction or\nevent, in which event the resulting entity shall be such other entity, and (2) subsequent to the consummation of a merger or consolidation that does not constitute a Change in Control, the term “Company” shall refer to the resulting\nentity and the term “Board of Directors” shall refer to the board of directors (or comparable governing body) of the resulting entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company engages in any transaction approved by the shareholders of\nthe Company and by the Board of Directors of the Company, and the Board of Directors of the Company (or any successor of the Company by merger, consolidation or otherwise) remains the Board of Directors of the Company (or any successor of the\nCompany by merger, consolidation or otherwise) immediately following such transaction, regardless of whether shareholders of the Company own a majority of the outstanding securities of the Company (or any successor of the Company by merger,\nconsolidation or otherwise), then such transaction shall not be considered a “Change in Control.”\n“Termination Benefits” means (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to 3 times Key Employee’s “Base Amount”, less $1.00.\n“Health Coverage” means that if Key Employee elects to continue coverage for himself or his eligible dependents under the Company’s group health plans pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget\nReconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”), during the twelve-month period commencing on the date of Key Employee’s termination of employment from the Company (the “Severance Period”), then throughout the Severance\nPeriod the Company shall promptly reimburse Key Employee on a monthly basis for the difference between the amount Key Employee pays to effect and continue such coverage and the employee contribution amount that active senior employees pay for the\nsame or similar coverage under Company’s group health plans. Further, if after the Severance Period Key Employee continues his COBRA coverage and Key Employee’s COBRA coverage terminates at any time during the eighteen-month period\ncommencing on the day immediately following the last day of the Severance Period (the “Extended Coverage Period”), then the Company shall provide Key Employee (and his eligible dependents) with health benefits substantially similar to\nthose provided under its group health plans for active employees for the remainder of the Extended Coverage Period at a cost to Key Employee that is no greater than the cost of COBRA coverage;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided, however, that the Company shall use its reasonable efforts so that such health benefits are\nprovided to Key Employee under one or more insurance policies (or such other manner) so that reimbursement or payment of benefits to Key Employee thereunder shall not result in taxable income to Key Employee. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions\nof this paragraph, the Company’s obligation to reimburse Key Employee during the Severance Period and to provide health benefits to Key Employee during the Extended Coverage Period shall immediately end if and to the extent Key Employee becomes\neligible to receive health plan coverage from a subsequent employer (with Key Employee being obligated hereunder to promptly report such eligibility to the Company).\n4.2 Termination By Expiration. If Key Employee’s employment hereunder shall terminate upon expiration of the term provided in paragraph 2.1 hereof because either party has provided the notice\ncontemplated in such paragraph, then all compensation and all benefits to Key Employee hereunder shall continue to be provided until the expiration of such term and such compensation and benefits shall terminate contemporaneously with termination of\nhis employment.\n4.3 Termination By the Company. If Key Employee’s employment hereunder shall be terminated by the\nCompany prior to expiration of the term provided in paragraph 2.1, then, upon such termination, regardless of the reason therefore, all compensation and benefits to Key Employee hereunder shall terminate contemporaneously with the termination of\nsuch employment; provided, however, that, subject to paragraph 4.7 below, if such termination shall be for any reason other than those encompassed by paragraph 2.2(i), 2.2(ii), or 2.2(iii), then the Company shall provide Key Employee with the\nTermination Benefits. Any lump sum cash payment due to Key Employee pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid to Key Employee within five business days of the date of Key Employee’s termination of employment with the Company; provided,\nhowever, that if the lump sum cash payment would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), then payment of the lump sum cash payment shall be deferred\nto the extent required to avoid such additional taxes and interest.\n4.4 Termination By Key Employee. If Key Employee’s\nemployment hereunder shall be terminated by Key Employee prior to expiration of the term provided in paragraph 2.1, then, upon such termination, regardless of the reason therefore, all compensation and benefits to Key Employee hereunder shall\nterminate contemporaneously with the termination of such employment; provided, however, that, subject to paragraph 4.7 below, if such termination occurs for Good Reason, then the Company shall provide Key Employee with the Termination Benefits. Any\nlump sum cash payment due to Key Employee pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to Key Employee within five business days of the date of Key Employee’s termination of employment with the Company; provided, however, that if the lump sum cash\npayment would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Section 409A of the Code, then payment of the lump sum cash payment shall be deferred to the extent required to avoid such additional taxes and interest.\n4.5 Change in Control Benefits. If Key Employee is employed by the Company on the date upon which a Change in Control occurs, then the\nCompany shall provide Key Employee with the Termination Benefits (other than Health Coverage), which benefits shall be determined as if Key Employee’s employment by the Company terminated on the date of such Change in Control; provided,\nhowever, that, if Key Employee is entitled to Termination Benefits under paragraph 4.3 or 4.4 of this Agreement as of the date of such Change in Control, then Key Employee shall not also be entitled to additional Termination Benefits under this\nparagraph. Any lump sum cash payment due to Key Employee pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid to Key Employee within five business days of the date of the Change in Control.\n4.6 Parachute Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Key Employee is a “disqualified\nindividual” (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), and the benefits provided for in this Article, together with any other payments and benefits which Key Employee has the right to receive from the Company and its affiliates, would\nconstitute a “parachute payment” (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then the benefits provided hereunder (beginning with any benefit to be paid in cash hereunder) shall be either (1) reduced (but not below zero) so\nthat the present value of such total amounts and benefits received by Key Employee will be one dollar ($1.00) less than three times Key Employee’s Base Amount and so that no portion of such amounts and benefits received by Key Employee shall be\nsubject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or (2) paid in full, whichever produces the better net after-tax position to Key Employee (taking into account any\n\n\n\n\n\n\napplicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and any other applicable taxes). The determination as to\nwhether any such reduction in the amount of the benefits provided hereunder is necessary shall be made initially by the Company in good faith. If a reduced benefit is provided hereunder in accordance with clause (1) of the first sentence of\nthis paragraph and through error or otherwise that payment, when aggregated with other payments and benefits from the Company (or its affiliates) used in determining if a “parachute payment” exists, exceeds one dollar ($1.00) less than\nthree times Key Employee’s base amount, then Key Employee shall immediately repay such excess to the Company upon notification that an overpayment has been made.\n4.7 Release and Full Settlement. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, as a condition to the receipt of Termination Benefits under paragraph 4.3 or 4.4 hereof, Key Employee shall first execute\na release, in the form established by the Board of Directors, releasing the Board of Directors, the Company, and the Company’s parent corporation, subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective shareholders, partners, officers, directors,\nemployees, attorneys and agents from any and all claims and from any and all causes of action of any kind or character including, but not limited to, all claims or causes of action arising out of Key Employee’s employment with the Company or\nits affiliates or the termination of such employment, but excluding all claims to vested benefits and payments Key Employee may have under any compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement, including this Agreement. The performance of the\nCompany’s obligations hereunder and the receipt of any benefits provided under paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 shall constitute full settlement of all such claims and causes of action.\n4.8 No Duty to Mitigate Losses. Key Employee shall have no duty to find new employment following the termination of his employment under\ncircumstances that require the Company to pay any amount to Key Employee pursuant to this Article 4. Except to the extent Key Employee becomes eligible to receive health plan coverage from a subsequent employer as provided in paragraph 4.1 with\nrespect to Health Coverage, any salary or remuneration received by Key Employee from a third party for the providing of personal services (whether by employment or by functioning as an independent contractor) following the termination of his\nemployment under circumstances pursuant to which this Article 4 apply shall not reduce the Company’s obligation to make a payment to Key Employee (or the amount of such payment) pursuant to the terms of this Article 4.\n4.9 Liquidated Damages. In light of the difficulties in estimating the damages for an early termination of Key Employee’s employment\nunder this Agreement, the Company and Key Employee hereby agree that the payments, if any, to be received by Key Employee pursuant to this Article 4 shall be received by Key Employee as liquidated damages.\n4.10 Other Benefits. This Agreement governs the rights and obligations of Key Employee and the Company with respect to Key Employee’s\nbase salary and certain perquisites of employment. Except as expressly provided herein, Key Employee’s rights and obligations both during the term of his employment and thereafter with respect to stock options, restricted stock, incentive and\ndeferred compensation, life insurance policies insuring the life of Key Employee, and other benefits under the plans and programs maintained by the Company shall be governed by the separate agreements, plans and other documents and instruments\ngoverning such matters.\nARTICLE 5: MISCELLANEOUS\n5.1 Notices. For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be\ndeemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or when mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:\n\n\n\nIf to the Company to:\t \t W&T Offshore, Inc.\nAttn: Tracy W.\nKrohn\nEight Greenway Plaza, Suite 1330\nHouston, TX\n77046\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf to Employee to:\t \tWilliam Talafuse\nW&T Offshore, Inc.\nEight Greenway Plaza, Suite\n1330\nHouston, Texas 77046\n\n\nor to such other address as either party may furnish to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that\nnotices or changes of address shall be effective only upon receipt.\n7.2 Applicable Law. This Agreement is entered into\nunder, and shall be governed for all purposes by, the laws of the State of Texas.\n7.3 No Waiver. No failure by either party\nhereto at any time to give notice of any breach by the other party of, or to require compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior\nor subsequent time.\n7.4 Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement\nis invalid or unenforceable, then the invalidity or unenforceability of that provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n7.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an\noriginal, but all of which together will constitute one and the same Agreement.\n7.6 Withholding of Taxes and Other Employee\nDeductions. The Company may withhold from any benefits and payments made pursuant to this Agreement all federal, state, city and other taxes as may be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling and all other normal\nemployee deductions made with respect to the Company’s employees generally.\n7.7 Headings. The paragraph headings have\nbeen inserted for purposes of convenience and shall not be used for interpretive purposes.\n7.8 Gender and Plurals. Wherever\nthe context so requires, the masculine gender includes the feminine or neuter, and the singular number includes the plural and conversely.\n7.9 Affiliate. As used in this Agreement, the term “affiliate” shall mean any entity which owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with, the Company.\n7.10 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor of the Company, by merger\nor otherwise. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this Agreement, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, are personal and neither this Agreement, nor any right, benefit, or obligation of either party hereto, shall be\nsubject to voluntary or involuntary assignment, alienation or transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.11 Term. This Agreement has a term co-extensive with the term of employment provided in\nparagraph 2.1. Termination shall not affect any right or obligation of any party that is accrued or vested prior to such termination.\n7.12 Entire Agreement. Except as provided in (i) the written benefit plans and programs referenced in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3(iii) (and any agreements between the Company and Key Employee that have been executed under such\nplans and programs) and (ii) any signed written agreement contemporaneously or hereafter executed by the Company and Key Employee, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and\ncontains all the covenants, promises, representations, warranties and agreements between the parties with respect to employment of Key Employee by the Company. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, all understandings and agreements\npreceding the date of execution of this Agreement and relating to the subject matter hereof (other than the agreements described in clause (i) of the preceding sentence) are hereby null and void and of no further force and effect.

If such question shall arise and Key Manager shall fail to submit such certification, the Company’s determination of such issue shall be binding on Key Manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing in this Section 4 (a) shall be construed to waive Key Manager’s rights, if any, under existing law including, without limitation, the\nFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. ss.2601 et seq. and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 42 U.S.C. ss.12101 et seq.\n\n\n(ii)\tUpon termination of Key Manager’s employment hereunder for either Disability or death, Key Manager or Key Manager’s estate (as the case may be) shall be entitled to\nreceive:\n\n\n\n(A)\tbase salary through Date of Termination;\n\n\n\n(B)\tany annual bonus earned but unpaid as of the Date of Termination for any previously completed fiscal year, Accrued Rights;\n\n\n\n(C)\treimbursement for any unreimbursed business expenses properly incurred by Key Manager in accordance with Company policy prior to the Date of Termination;\n\n\n\n\n(D)\tsuch employee benefits, if any, as to which Key Manager may be entitled under the employee benefit plans of the company; and\n\n\n\n(E)\tfifty percent (50%) of the Base Salary multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of the calendar year of termination that shall have elapsed\nthrough the date of Key Manager’s termination of employment and the denominator of which is 365.\n\nFollowing Key Manager’s\ntermination of employment due to death or Disability, except as set forth in this Section 4 (a) (ii), Key Manager shall have no further rights to any compensation or any benefits under this Agreement.\n(b) By the Company\n(i) The Company may terminate the\nKey Manager’s employment during the Employment Period for Cause or without Cause, and\n(ii) “Cause” means,\n(A) the Key Manager’s conviction or plea of nolo contendere to a felony, or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, deceit,\ndishonesty or fraud that relates to Company property,\n(B) the continued and willful, intentional or grossly negligent\nfailure by the Key Manager to substantially perform the Key Manager’s duties hereunder (other than as a result of total or partial incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure the same, or\n\n(C) the willful, intentional or grossly negligent conduct of the Key Manager which is demonstrably and materially injurious\nto the Company and its affiliates taken as a whole, monetarily or otherwise.\nFor purposes of this subparagraph (ii), no\nact, or failure to act, on the Key Manager’s part shall be deemed willful, intentional or grossly negligent if the Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManager acted in good faith and in a manner that the Key Manager reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company.\n\n(c) Due to Change of Control\n(i) A\nChange of Control occurs with the Company or any affiliate thereof which then employs Key Manager at any time during the Employment Period.\n(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, “Change of Control” shall mean an event of merger, consolidation, sale, joint venture, partnership, or other business arrangement with a third party whereby the Key Manager is not offered a\nposition after such a transaction that is comparable to Key Manager’s position with the Company and with at least the same Annual Base Salary, target bonus, long-term incentive award levels and other benefits (other than such changes in\nbenefits applicable to employees generally) as were in effect for the Key Manager immediately preceding the Change of Control, and that is not more than 15 miles away from a city with a population of at least 100,000 people and is located in the\ncontinental United States.\n(d) Termination Procedures\n(i) Notice of Termination Any purported termination of the Key Manager’s employment by the Company (other than by reason of Death or the expiration of the Employment Period) shall be communicated by\nwritten Notice of Termination from one party hereto to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 11(b) hereof. For purposes of this Employment Agreement, a “Notice of Termination” shall mean a notice which shall indicate the\nspecific termination provision in this Employment Agreement relied upon and, in the case of a termination for Disability or Cause, shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Key\nManager’s employment.\n(ii) Date of Termination Except as otherwise provided in Section 10(c) of this Employment Agreement,\n“Date of Termination,” with respect to any purported termination of the Key Manager’s employment during the Employment Period (other than for Death), shall mean the date specified in the Notice of Termination, except that with respect\nto any termination that is not for cause, death, or disability, the Date of Termination shall mean 30 calendar days after the Notice of Termination is delivered to Key Manager.\n(iii) No Waiver The failure to set forth any fact or circumstance in a Notice of Termination shall not constitute a waiver of the right to assert,\nand shall not preclude the party giving notice from assertion, such fact or circumstance in an attempt to enforce any right under or provision of this Employment Agreement.\n5. Obligations of the Company upon Termination\n(a) Payments and Benefits Upon Termination By the Company Other\nthan for Cause or Death or Disability If, during the Employment Period, the Company terminates the Key Manager’s employment other than for Cause or Death or Disability, the Company shall pay to the Key Manager in a lump sum in cash\nwithin thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination, the greater of the following amounts calculated in (i) or (ii) below,\n(i) the sum of (A) any portion of the Key Manager’s Annual Base Salary through the Employment Period not adjusted for merit increases; (B) with respect to any annual bonus plan contemplated under Section 3(b) of this\nEmployment Agreement, an amount representing the target annual bonus for the remainder of the Employment Period; (C) any compensation previously deferred by the Key Manager (together with any accrued\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninterest or earnings thereon) that has not yet been paid; and (D) any accrued but unpaid incentive compensation and vacation pay; or\n(ii) any severance payments due the Executive under the Company Severance Program in effect at the time of Termination (the “Severance\nProgram”); or\n(iii) one (1) year of base salary;\nprovided, however, that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Employment Agreement, the Severance Program and any other severance obligation of the Company, and the payment under this Section 5(a)\nshall be offset by any amount otherwise payable under any such agreement, program or obligation and any payment in lieu of notice of termination of employment required by federal, state or local law. After payment of the above amount, the Company\nshall have no further obligations under this Employment Agreement, the Severance Program or any other severance obligation of the Company; provided however, the Key Manager shall be entitled to all vested benefits under any welfare or benefit plan\napplicable to employees and available after termination.\n(b) Payments and Benefits Upon Death or Disability If the Key Manager’s employment is\nterminated by reason of the Key Manager’s Death or Disability during the Employment Period, the Company shall pay to the Key Manager or, in the case of the Key Manager’s Death, to the Key Manager’s designated beneficiaries (or, if\nthere is no such beneficiary, to the Key Manager’s estate or legal representative) in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination, the sum of the following amounts,\n(i) any portion of the Manager’s Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination that has not yet been paid,\n(ii) with respect to any annual bonus plan contemplated under Section 3(b) of this Employment Agreement, an amount representing the target annual\nbonus for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, computed by taking the target level and multiplying that amount by the Annual Base Salary multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such period through the\nDate of Termination and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the relevant period,\n(iii) any compensation previously\ndeferred by the Key Manager (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) that has not yet been paid, and\n(iv) any accrued but\nunpaid incentive compensation and vacation pay; and the Company shall have no further obligations under this Employment Agreement, except as specified in Section 6 below.\n(c) Payments and Benefits By the Company for Cause If the Key Manager’s employment is terminated by the Company for Cause during the Employment Period, the Company shall pay the Key Manager the Annual Base\nSalary through the Date of Termination and the amount of any compensation previously deferred by the Key Manager (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon), in each case to the extent not yet paid, accrued but unused vacation, and any\nincentive compensation earned per the terms of the 2005 Management Incentive Plan or any similar incentive plan implemented during the Employment Period. The Company shall have no further obligations under this Employment Agreement, except as\nspecified in Section 6 below.\n6. Non-Exclusivity of Rights Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Employment Agreement, nothing in\nthis Employment Agreement shall prevent or limit the Key Manager’s continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies for which the Key Manager may qualify,\nprovided that any such plan, program or policy may be amended or terminated by the Company in its sole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscretion. Vested benefits and other amounts that the Key Manager is otherwise entitled to receive under any other plan, policy, practice, or program of the\nCompany or any of its affiliated companies on or after the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with the terms of each such plan, policy, practice or program (subject to the Company’s right to amend such terms), as the case may\nbe, except as explicitly modified by this Employment Agreement.\n7. Full Settlement The Company’s obligation to make the payments provided for\nin, and otherwise to perform its obligation under, this Employment Agreement shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action that the Company may have against the Key Manager or others. In no\nevent shall the Key Manager be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Key Manager under any of the provisions of this Employment Agreement and the amount of any payment or\nbenefit provided for in this Employment Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Key Manager as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the Key\nManager to the Company or otherwise.\n8. Confidential Information\n(a)\n(i) The Key Manager shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company and its\naffiliates all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies and their respective businesses that the Key Manager obtains during the Key Manager’s employment by the Company or\nany of its affiliated companies and that is not public knowledge (other than as a result of the Key Manager’s violation of this Section 8) (“Confidential Information”).\n(ii) “Confidential Information” shall not include any information that is (a) generally known to the industry or the public other than as a\nresult of Key Manager’s breach of this covenant or any breach of other confidentiality obligations by third parties; (b) made legitimately available to Key Manager by a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or\n(c) required by law to be disclosed; provided that Key Manager shall give prompt written notice to the Company of such requirement, disclose no more information than is so required, and cooperate with any attempts by the Company to obtain a\nprotective order or similar treatment.\n(iii) The Key Manager shall not communicate, divulge, or disseminate Confidential Information at any\ntime during or after the Key Manager’s employment with the Company, except with the prior written consent of the Company or as otherwise required by law or legal process. In no event shall any asserted violation of the provisions of this\nSection 8 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Key Manager under this Employment Agreement.\n(b) The\nKey Manager acknowledges that if the Key Manager shall breach or threaten to breach paragraph (a) of this Section 8, the damages to the Company and its affiliates may be substantial, although difficult to ascertain, and money damages will\nnot afford the Company and its affiliates an adequate remedy. Therefore, if the paragraph (a) of the Section 8 is violated, in whole or in part, the Company and its affiliates shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive\nrelief, without prejudice to other remedies the Company and/or its affiliates may have at law or in equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Non-Competition Key Manager acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the\nCompany and its affiliates and accordingly, as partial consideration for the Company entering into this Employment Agreement, agrees as follows:\n(a)\nDuring the Employment Period, if the Key Manager ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason, other than due to Company’s failure to renew the Employment Period pursuant to Section 1, the Key Manager will not, whether on Key\nManager’s own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any person, firm, partnership, joint venture association, corporation or other business organization, entity or enterprise whatsoever (“Person”), directly or indirectly\nsolicit or assist in soliciting in competition with the Company, the business of any customer of the Company or prospective customer of the Company:\n(i) with whom Key Manager had personal contact or dealings on behalf of the Company during the one year period preceding Key Manager’s termination of employment;\n(ii) with whom employees reporting to Key Manager have had personal contact or dealings on behalf of the Company during the one year period immediately\npreceding Key Manager’s termination of employment; or\n(iii) for whom Key Manager had direct or indirect responsibility during the one\nyear period immediately preceding Key Manager’s termination of employment.\n\n\n(b)\tDuring the Employment Period, Key Manager will not directly or indirectly:\n\n(i) engage in any coal-related business that competes with the business of the Company or its affiliates (including, without limitation, businesses which the Company or its affiliates have specific plans to conduct in\nthe future and as to which Key Manager is aware of such planning) in the United States (a “Competitive Business”);\n(ii) enter the\nemploy of, or render any services to, any Person (or any division or controlled or controlling affiliate of any Person) who or which engages in a Competitive Business;\n(iii) acquire a financial interest in, or otherwise become actively involved with, any Competitive Business, directly or indirectly, as an individual, partner, shareholder, officer, director, principal, agent, trustee\nor consultant; or\n(iv) interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, business relationships (whether formed before, on or after the date of\nthe Agreement) between the Company or any of its affiliates and customers, clients, suppliers’ partners, members or investors of the Company or its affiliates.\n(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Employment Agreement, Key Manager may, directly or indirectly own, solely as an investment, securities of any Person engaged in the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbusiness of the Company or affiliates which are publicly traded on a national or regional stock exchange or on the over-the-counter market if Key Manager\n(i) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and (ii) does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such Person.\n(d) During the Employment Period or for one (1) year following any Date of Termination, if the Key Manager ceases to be employed by the Company, Key Manager will\nnot, whether on Key Manager’s own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any Persons, directly or indirectly:\n(i) solicit or\nencourage any employee of the Company or its affiliates to leave the employment of the Company or its affiliates; or\n(ii) hire any such\nemployee who was employed by the Company or it affiliates as of the date of Key Manager’s termination of employment with the Company or who left the employment of the Company or its affiliates coincident with, or within one year prior to or\nafter, the termination of Key Manager’s employment with the Company.\nKey Manager contacted by any employee of the Company does not violate this\nprovision of the Agreement, however, any solicitation or encouragement by Key Manager as a result of the initial contact is prohibited.\n(e) During the\nEmployment Period or for one (1) year following any Date of Termination, Key Manager will not, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage to cease to work with the Company or its affiliates any consultant then under contract with the company\nor its affiliates, however Key Manager contacted by any employee of the Company does not violate this provision of the Agreement. Any solicitation or encouragement by Key Manager as a result of the initial contact is prohibited.\n(f) It is expressly understood and agreed that although Key Manager and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Section 9 to be reasonable, if a\nfinal judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable restriction against Key Manager, the provisions of this Agreement shall not be\nrendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds\nthat any restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.\n\n\n\n10.\tSuccessors\n\n(a) This Employment Agreement is personal to the Key\nManager and, without the prior written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by the Key Manager otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Employment Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by\nthe Key Manager’s legal representatives. If the Key Manager shall die while any amount would still be payable to the Key Manager hereunder had the Key Manager continued to live (other than amounts which by their terms, terminate upon the death\nof the Key Manager), then all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the terms of this Employment Agreement to the executors, personal representatives or administrators of the Key Manager’s estate.\n(b) This Employment Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.\n(c) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business\nand/or assets of the Company expressly to assume and agree to perform this Employment Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would have been required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the\nCompany to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effective date of any such succession shall be a breach of this Employment Agreement and shall entitle the Key Manager to compensation from the Company as if the he were terminated without\ncause. For purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be treated as the Date of Termination and shall entitle the Key Manager to compensation from the Company. As used in this Employment\nAgreement, “Company” shall mean both the Company as defined above and any such successor that assumes and agrees to perform this Employment Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise.\n\n\n11.\tMiscellaneous\n\n(a) This Employment Agreement shall be governed by,\nand construed in accordance with, the laws of Maryland, without reference to principles of conflict of laws.

The Company has entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Ligouri to serve as our Chief Operating Officer starting January 19, 2010 through January 18, 2013.  The employment agreement may be renewed by the parties for an additional one-year term. Mr. Ligouri's base salary will be $1 million and future salary increases will be reviewed and decided in accordance with the Company's standard practices and procedures for similarly-situated employees, but in no event will Mr. Ligouri's salary be reduced.  Mr. Ligouri's annual incentive compensation plan target amount will equal 100% of his base salary.  There is no guaranteed bonus amount.  Mr. Ligouri will also receive a signing bonus of $200,000 within 20 days of the commencement of his employment.  If Mr. Ligouri terminates hi\ns employment within one year of his hire date other than for Good Reason, he will be required to repay the signing bonus in full.  \"Good Reason\" means: (a) a material reduction in his duties or responsibilities, (b) a material change in his work location from the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, (c) the change of his reporting relationship to a level below the Company's chief executive officer, or (d) a material breach of the employment agreement by the Company as it relates to the recommendation of Mr. Ligouri to receive the equity awards described below, provided that the Company has been given 60 days notice to cure any such breach and has failed to do so within 30 days of receipt of such notice.  Mr. Ligouri is also eligible to participate in and receive any and all benefits the Company generally makes available to its other executives at Mr. Ligouri's level in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable plan or arrangement.\nDuring the first 90 days of 2010, Mr. Ligouri will be recom\nmended to be granted non-qualified stock options with a target value of $1,250,000 and performance restricted stock units with a target value of $1,250,000.  The performance targets for the restricted stock units have not yet been determined.  Mr. Ligouri would also be considered for annual equity grants in 2011 and 2012, in accordance with the Company's normal executive compensation processes and practices.\nIf Mr. Ligouri's employment is terminated without Cause, or for Good Reason, the Company will make the following severance payments: (a) current salary for the longer of the balance of the term of the employment agreement, 6 months, or the length of time for which Mr. Ligouri would otherwise be eligible to receive severance payments under the Company's severance plan then in effect; (b) the prorated portion of Mr. Ligouri's bonus under the Company's bonus or incentive plan for the year in which the termination occurs (subject to achievement of the applicable performance metrics); and (c) reimbursement\nfor up to 18 months of continued health coverage under COBRA should he be eligible for and elect COBRA benefits, provided that if the severance period is longer than 18 months, Mr. Ligouri would be eligible to receive at the end of the 18 month period an amount equal to the then-current COBRA premium for the number of months remaining in the severance period.  These severance amounts are contingent on Mr. Ligouri executing a release in favor of the Company.  Additionally, if Mr. Ligouri secures employment or any consulting, contractor or other business arrangement for services during the period during which the Company is providing severance payments, the Company would have the right to reduce the amounts otherwise payable under the employment agreement by the amount Mr. Ligouri receives for those services.   If the Company does not elect to negotiate to renew the agreement, Mr. Ligouri would be entitled to the severance benefits described above.\nIf Mr. Ligouri's employment is terminated for\nCause, for a period of 12 months after the conclusion of his employment, he will not perform any work on, related to, or respecting non-fiction television programming or engage in any activities on behalf of any company or any entity related to nonfiction television programming services for distribution to cable, satellite and/or other multi-channel distribution platforms.  If Mr. Ligouri's employment is terminated not for Cause or for Good Reason or the agreement expires according to its terms, he will no longer be subject to the non-competition clause described in the preceding sentence.  \"Cause\" means (a) the conviction of, or nolo contendere or guilty plea, to a felony (whether any right to appeal has been or may be exercised); (b) conduct constituting embezzlement, material misappropriation or fraud, whether or not related to Mr. Ligouri's employment with the Company; (c) conduct constituting a financial crime, material act of dishonesty or conduct in violation of Company's Code of Business Conduct and\nEthics; (d) improper conduct substantially prejudicial to the Company's business; (e) willful unauthorized disclosure or use of Company confidential information; (f) material improper destruction of Company property; or (g) willful misconduct in connection with the performance of Mr. Ligouri's duties.\nMr. Ligouri is also eligible for benefits under the Company's relocation policy for executives at his job level for a relocation in 2011 or 2012.  In addition to the benefits under the relocation policy, the Company will provide Mr. Ligouri with an expense payment of $100,000 within the first 30 days of employment, with the expense payment designed to defray, in part, costs such as transitional housing, furniture rental and the purchase of needed household items.  The Company has also agreed to reimburse Mr. Ligouri for up to $40,000 for travel expenses incurred in 2010, up to $40,000 for travel expenses incurred in 2011 and up to $20,000 for travel expenses incurred in 2012, provided that these reimbursemen\nts will cease to be available in the event that Mr. Ligouri has moved his principal place of residence to the Washington D.C. area.  The Company will also provide Mr. Ligouri with a suitable corporate apartment in the Washington, D.C. area for the first six months of his employment (monthly cost not to exceed $5,000) and will reimburse Mr. Ligouri for certain other costs associated with his relocation.  If the Company offers renewal of his employment agreement on terms no less favorable than those contained in the agreement, and Mr. Ligouri declines, Mr. Ligouri would be required to repay the Company an amount equivalent to the benefits under the relocation policy described above that were incurred within 12 months prior to the end of the term of Mr. Ligouri's employment.\nPrior to joining the Company, Mr. Ligouri, age 49, has been a consultant to Comcast Corp.  He also served as Chairman, Entertainment for Fox Broadcasting Company (\"Fox\") from July 2007 until March 2009 and had served as President, Enter\ntainment for Fox since 2005.  Prior to that, Mr. Ligouri served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of FX Networks from 1998 until 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSIGNATURES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto\nduly authorized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery Communications, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: December 10, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/s/    Joseph A.

If Mr. Caruso resigns for Good Reason or is terminated without Cause (as such terms are defined in the employment agreement), or upon his death, he will be entitled to receive his base salary through the termination date and any accrued benefits, and all of his unvested common units will immediately be deemed fully vested as of the termination date.\nMr. Caruso is restricted from participating in a competing business and soliciting the Company’s current customers or hiring\nthe Company's existing employees or contractors through July 2, 2017, except that these restrictions will not apply to Mr. Caruso in the event of a Company sale, his termination without Cause or his voluntary resignation with Good Reason or in certain other circumstances set forth in the employment agreement.\n\n\nAlso on February 15, 2014, the Board of Managers of the Company approved an advance distribution of cash to Mr. Caruso in respect of his common units in the amount of $3,000,000 pursuant to a letter agreement with Mr. Caruso.  Accordingly, Mr. Caruso will forfeit the first $3,000,000 in future distributions made in respect of his common units under the CII Operating Agreement.\n\n\nThe employment agreement and letter agreement executed with Mr. Caruso effective February 15, 2014 are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in full.\n\n\n\nItem 9.01.\nFinancial Statements and Exhibits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Exhibits\n\n\n10.1    Employment Agreement among Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC, Zayo Group, LLC and Daniel P.

{"content": "10.1EmploymentAgreementJasonGarrett\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Agreement\nSpark Energy, Inc.\n\n\nThis Employment Agreement (this “Agreement”) dated August 3, 2015 is between Jason Garrett (“Employee”) and Spark Energy, Inc. (the “Company”).  Capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined are defined in Exhibit B to this Agreement.\n1.Employment.  The Company will employ Employee in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and Exhibit A to this Agreement. During the Term (as defined in Exhibit A to this Agreement), Employee will devote his full business time, attention and best efforts to the business of the Company, as may be requested by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).  Employee acknowledges and agrees that he owes the Company fiduciary duties, including duties of loyalty and disclosure, and that the obligations described in this Agreement are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the obligations owed to the Company and its subsidiaries under common law.\n2.    Termination of Employment.\n(a)    Right to Terminate for Convenience.  Either the Company or Employee shall have the right to terminate the employment under this Agreement for convenience at any time and for any reason, or no reason at all, upon written notice to the other party. Such termination shall be effective immediately unless otherwise agreed between the parties.\n(b)    Company’s Right to Terminate Employee’s Employment for Cause.  The Company shall have the right to terminate Employee’s employment at any time for Cause.\n(c)    Employee’s Right to Terminate for Good Reason.  Employee shall have the right to terminate Employee’s employment with the Company at any time for Good Reason.  Any assertion by Employee of a termination for Good Reason shall not be effective unless all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the condition giving rise to Employee’s termination of employment must have arisen without Employee’s written consent; (ii) Employee must provide written notice to the Board of the existence of such condition(s) within 30 days of the initial existence of such condition(s); (iii) the condition(s) specified in such notice must remain uncorrected for 30 days following the Board’s receipt of such written notice; and (iv) the date of Employee’s termination of employment must occur within 75 days after the initial existence of the condition(s) specified in such notice.\n(d)    Death or Disability.  Upon the death or Disability of Employee, Employee’s employment with Company shall terminate with no further obligation under this Agreement of either party hereunder.\n(e)    Effect of Termination.\n(i)    If Employee’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause pursuant to Section 2(a) above, is terminated as a result of a non-renewal of the Term of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Exhibit A, or is terminated by Employee for Good Reason pursuant to Section 2(c) above, and Employee: (A) executes within 50 days following the date on which Employee’s employment terminates, and does not revoke within the time provided by the Company to do so, a release of all claims in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Release”); and (B) abides by Employee’s continuing obligations under Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement, then the Company shall pay to\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee any bonus earned for the calendar year prior to the year in which the termination occurs but which is unpaid as of the date of termination (which shall be paid to Employee on the same date as such bonus would have been paid had Employee remained in employment) (the “Post-Termination Bonus Payment”) and make severance payments to Employee in a total amount equal to: (X) 12 months’ worth of Employee’s Base Salary; plus (Y) an additional amount equal to the target annual bonus for the Employee for the year in which Employee is terminated prorated up to the date of termination for the number of days worked during such calendar year and calculated based on relative achievement of key performance targets as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board in its reasonable discretion (such total severance payments being referred to as the “Severance Payment”).  For the avoidance of doubt, a non-renewal of the Term of this Agreement by Employee, a termination by reason of Employee’s death or Disability, a termination by the Company for Cause or a termination of employment by Employee without Good Reason under Section 2(a) above shall not give rise to a right to the Severance Payment or Post-Termination Bonus Payment.\n(ii)    The Severance Payment will be paid in substantially equal monthly installments in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll practices, beginning on Company’s first pay date that is on or after the 60th day following the date of termination of employment; provided, however, that the first installment payment shall include all amounts that would otherwise have been paid to Employee during the period beginning at termination and ending on the first payment date (without interest) if no delay had been imposed. Any Severance Payment is conditional upon Employee’s compliance with Sections 3 and 4.  Each payment of a portion of the Severance Payment under this Agreement is intended to be a series of separate payments and not as the entitlement to a single payment for purposes of Section 409A.  For purposes of this Agreement, references to Employee’s termination of employment shall mean, and be interpreted in accordance with, Employee’s “separation from service” from the Company within the meaning of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii).\n(iii)    Upon a termination of employment by Employee for Good Reason, by the Company for convenience or non-renewal by the Company, then all outstanding unvested long term incentive awards granted to the Employee during his employment with the Company under the Long Term Incentive Plan shall become fully vested and exercisable for the remainder of their full term in accordance with, and subject to, any applicable agreements and plan documents as may be amended from time to time.\n(iv)     Upon a Change of Control, the Employee shall retain all outstanding long term incentive awards previously granted to Employee under the Long Term Incentive Plan subject to existing vesting schedules, provided that all such awards shall be modified by the Compensation Committee in its discretion to reflect the consideration, whether in shares of stock, other securities, cash or property that the Employee would be entitled to receive had he vested into such awards immediately prior to the Change of Control. For the avoidance of doubt, all such modified awards shall remain subject to the vesting requirements in effect for such awards prior to the Change of Control and shall remain subject to all applicable agreements and plan documents as may be amended from time to time.\n3.    Confidentiality.  The Company will provide Employee and give Employee access to Confidential Information during the Term. Employee will hold all Confidential Information in a fiduciary\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncapacity for the benefit of the Company.  During the Term and at all times after termination of Employee’s employment hereunder, Employee will: (a) not disclose any Confidential Information to any person or entity other than in the proper performance of his duties during the Term; (b) not use any Confidential Information except for the benefit of the Company; and (c) take all such precautions as may be reasonably necessary to prevent the disclosure to any third party of any of the Confidential Information.\nUpon termination of employment, Employee will surrender and deliver to the Company all documents (including electronically stored information) and other materials of any nature containing or pertaining to all Confidential Information and any other Company property or property of its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any Company-issued computer, mobile device, credit card, or other equipment or property), in Employee’s possession, custody and control and Employee will not retain any such document or other materials or property.\n4.    Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.\n(a)    The Company shall provide Employee access to the Confidential Information for use only during the Term, and Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company will be entrusting Employee, in Employee’s unique and special capacity, with developing the goodwill of the Company and its subsidiaries, and in consideration thereof and in consideration of the access to Confidential Information and as a condition to the Company’s entry into this Agreement and employment of Employee, and Employee’s receipt of equity-based compensation pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan as described in Exhibit A, Employee has voluntarily agreed to the covenants set forth in this Section 4.  Employee further agrees and acknowledges that the limitations and restrictions set forth herein, including geographical and temporal restrictions on certain competitive activities, are reasonable in all respects and are material and substantial parts of this Agreement intended and necessary to prevent unfair competition and to protect the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ legitimate business interests, including the protection of its Confidential Information and goodwill.\n(b)    Employee agrees that, during the period that he is employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and continuing through the date that is 12 months following the date that Employee is no longer employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Employee shall not, without the prior written approval of the Company, directly or indirectly, for himself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person or entity of whatever nature engage in any Prohibited Activity.\n(c)    During the Term and at all times following the termination of Employee’s employment for whatever reason, Employee shall not (except to the extent required by law) disparage, and shall cause the Employee’s affiliates not to disparage, either orally or in writing, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of their directors, officers, managers, agents, representatives, stockholders, investors, partners, members, or employees, or any of their respective businesses, products, services or practices. During the Term and at all times following the termination of Employee’s employment for whatever reason, the Company shall not (except to the extent required by law) disparage, and shall cause the Company’s subsidiaries not to disparage, either orally or in writing, the Employee.\n(d)    Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to the Company as a result of a breach of the foregoing covenants, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that would be caused to the Company for which it would have no other adequate remedy, Employee agrees that the Company and its subsidiaries shall be entitled to enforce the foregoing covenants, in the event of a breach, by injunctions and restraining orders and that such enforcement shall not be the Company’s or such subsidiary’s exclusive\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremedy for a breach but instead shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies available to the Company or its subsidiaries at law and equity.\n(e)    The covenants in this Section 4, and each provision and portion thereof, are severable and separate, and the unenforceability of any specific covenant shall not affect the provisions of any other covenant.  Moreover, in the event any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that the scope, time or territorial restrictions set forth are unreasonable, then it is the intention of the parties that such restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent which the arbitrator or court deems reasonable, and this Agreement shall thereby be reformed.\n5.    Stock Ownership Policy.  On and after April 1, 2019, Employee is expected to hold a number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Stock”) with an aggregate value equal to two times Employee’s Base Salary (such value to be determined based on the closing price of a share of Stock as of December 31 of the prior year (the “Stock Ownership Requirement”).   The Stock Ownership Requirement shall be measured on April 1 of each year beginning in 2019. Until the applicable Stock Ownership Requirement is achieved, Employee is encouraged to retain the net shares obtained through the Company’s stock incentive plans.   “Net shares” are those shares that remain after shares are sold or netted to pay the exercise price of stock options (if applicable) and withholding taxes.  To the extent Employee falls below the Stock Ownership Requirement after April 1, 2019, Employee will be required to retain 100% of the net shares obtained through the Company’s stock incentive plans until the Stock Ownership Requirement is met.  In the event of a drop in the share price of the Stock from the beginning of each fiscal year through the end of such year commencing with fiscal year 2018 and for each fiscal year thereafter of more than twenty-five percent (25%), Employee will be entitled to an additional twelve month period commencing on April 1 of the next year to comply with the Stock Ownership Requirement.  Failure to satisfy the Stock Ownership Requirement may impact Employee’s eligibility to receive future cash and equity incentive compensation awards.  All shares of Stock held by Employee (including (i) shares purchased on the open market or (ii) shares held indirectly by Employee (a) under any retirement or deferred compensation plan or (b) held by a spouse or other immediate family member residing in the same household or (c) in a trust for the benefit of  Employee or his family (whether held individually or jointly)) and all shares of Stock underlying awards granted under the Company’s long term incentive plan and which can be settled in Stock (whether vested or unvested, exercised or unexercised, or settled or unsettled) will count towards the Stock Ownership Requirement.  Performance awards held by Employee will count towards the Stock Ownership Requirement at the target level of such awards until settled.\n6.    Applicable Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.  This Agreement shall in all respects be construed according to the laws of the State of Texas without regard to its conflict of laws principles that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.  With respect to any claim or dispute related to or arising under this Agreement or relating to Employee’s employment or the termination thereof, the parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the state and federal courts located in Houston, Texas.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its subsidiaries shall be entitled to enforce their rights under Section 4 in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n7.    Entire Agreement and Amendment.  This Agreement, the Long Term Incentive Plan and the award agreement evidencing any equity compensation awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters covered herein; moreover, this Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, oral or written, between the parties hereto concerning the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument executed by both parties hereto.\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.    Waiver of Breach.  Any waiver of this Agreement must be executed by the party to be bound by such waiver.  No waiver by either party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party, or of compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party, will operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by such other party or any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any subsequent time.  The failure of either party hereto to take any action by reason of any breach will not deprive such party of the right to take action at any time while such breach continues.\n9.    Assignment.  This Agreement is personal to Employee, and neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder shall be assignable or otherwise transferred by Employee.  The Company may assign this Agreement without Employee’s consent, including to any subsidiary of the Company and to any successor (whether by merger, purchase or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the equity, assets or businesses of the Company.\n10.    Notices.  Notices provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly received when delivered in person or on the third business day following deposit in the United States mail, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested:  to the address of the Company’s principal offices, Attention: General Counsel, if to the Company; and to the home address of the Employee on file with the Company if to the Employee.\n11.    Section 409A.  If any provision of this Agreement does not satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, then such provision shall nevertheless be applied in a manner consistent with those requirements.  Any payments under this Agreement that may be excluded from Section 409A either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service or as a short-term deferral shall be excluded from Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement are exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the Employee on account of non-compliance with Section 409A.  If any payment or benefit provided to the Employee in connection with his termination of employment is determined to constitute \"nonqualified deferred compensation\" within the meaning of Section 409A and the Employee is determined to be a \"specified employee\" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(b)(i), then all such payments or benefits shall not be paid until the first payroll date to occur following the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date  in a lump sum, and thereafter, any remaining payments shall be paid without delay in accordance with their original schedule.\n12.    Effect of Termination.  The provisions of Sections 2(e), 3, 4, 6 and 11 and those provisions necessary to interpret and enforce them, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and any termination of the employment relationship between Employee and the Company.\n13.    Third-Party Beneficiaries.  Each subsidiary of the Company that is not a signatory to this Agreement is an intended, third-party beneficiary of Employee’s obligations under Sections 3 and 4 above and shall be entitled to enforce such obligations as if a party hereto.\n14.    Severability.  If an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the invalidity or unenforceability of that provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/s/ Jason Garrett\nEmployee Name: Jason Garrett\n\n\n\n\nSPARK ENERGY, INC.\n\n\n\n\nBy: /s/ Nathan Kroeker\nName: Nathan Kroeker\nTitle:President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT A TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT OF JASON GARRETT\n\n\nTitle:  Executive Vice President, Spark Retail\n\n\nDuties: Those normally incidental to the title identified above, as well as such additional duties as may be assigned to Employee by the Board from time to time.\n\n\nTerm:  The initial term of this Agreement shall be for the period beginning on the date of the Agreement and ending on December 31, 2015.

Kerschner entered into an employment agreement pursuant to which Mr. Kerschner will serve as Executive Vice President of CDI.  It is anticipated that he will be elected as the Chief Financial Officer of CDI following the filing of the company's Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2005.  Mr. Kerschner's employment with the company began on September 6, 2005.Mr. Kerschner's compensation consists of the following:\nBase Salary - He will be paid a salary at the rate of $310,000 per year.\nCash Bonus - Contingent upon CDI's financial performance, Mr. Kerschner will be eligible to receive a target bonus for 2005 equal to 50% of his base salary, pro rated from the date his employment started, with a minimum bonus payment of $30,000 provided he remains employed by CDI through December 31, 2005.\nStock Appreciation Rights - Upon the start of his employment, Mr. Kerschner was awarded 10,000 Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs).  These SARs entitle him t\no receive, upon exercise of the SARs, the increase in the market value of the specified number of shares of CDI common stock from the date of grant of the SARs to the date of exercise, payable in shares of CDI common stock (after deductions are made to satisfy withholding and payroll tax obligations).  The SARs vest 20% per year on the first five anniversaries of the date of grant.  The SARs have a seven-year term, though they generally terminate earlier if Mr. Kerschner's employment with the company ends.\nTime-vested Deferred Stock - Upon the start of his employment, Mr. Kerschner was awarded 2,500 shares of time-vested Deferred Stock.  Also, for each share of CDI common stock which he purchases (up to 20,000 shares) within a specified 15-day period following the start of his employment, Mr. Kerschner will be granted an additional 0.4 shares of time-vested Deferred Stock.  The time-vested Deferred Stock entitles Mr. Kerschner to receive the specified number of shares of CDI common stock upon vesting.  The\nshares of time-vested Deferred Stock vest 20% per year on the first five anniversaries of the date of grant.  Deferred Stock will generally terminate prior to vesting if Mr. Kerschner's employment with the company ends.  With regard to the additional shares of time-vested Deferred Stock which Mr. Kerschner may receive based on his purchases of up to 20,000 shares of CDI common stock, if he sells or transfers any of those underlying shares of CDI common stock during the five-year vesting period, then the remaining  unvested shares of Deferred Stock will be forfeited.\nPerformance-contingent Deferred Stock - Upon the start of his employment, Mr. Kerschner was awarded 5,000 shares of performance-contingent Deferred Stock.  The performance-contingent Deferred Stock entitles him to receive all or a portion of the specified number of shares of CDI common stock based on CDI's achievement of established levels of EVA (Economic Value Added) growth in 2005 (provided that there must be positive EVA for the year in\norder to receive any shares).  EVA is equal to the company's net operating profit after taxes in excess of the cost of capital of the net assets employed in the company's business.\nIn addition to the above compensation terms, Mr. Kerschner's employment agreement contains covenants restricting him from competing with CDI or soliciting its customers and employees following the expiration or termination of his employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignature(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPursuant to the Requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the Undersigned hereunto\nduly authorized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDI Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: September 12, 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy:\n\n\n\n\n/s/    JOSEPH R.

Termination of Employment Following a Change of Control. Following a\nChange of Control, if the Employee's employment is terminated for any reason\nother than Cause, death or Disability, or if the Employee voluntarily terminates\nhis employment (a) within a period of six (6) months following the Change of\nControl, or (b) for Good Reason, then the Company shall pay to the Employee the\nAccrued Obligations and an amount equal to 2.99 times the sum of the Employee's\nannual base salary and the highest annual bonus paid to the Employee during the\nEmployee's tenure with the Company; and for eighteen (18) months after the\nEmployee's date of termination, the Company shall continue group medical\nbenefits to the Employee and/or the Employee's family at least equal to those\nwhich would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans if the\nEmployee's employment had not been terminated; provided, however, that if the\nEmployee becomes re-employed with another employer and is eligible to receive\ngroup medical benefits under another employer provided plan, the medical\nbenefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other\nplan during such applicable period of eligibility.

Certain Additional Payments by the Company.\n\n(a)  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and\nexcept as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined\nthat any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the\nbenefit of the Employee (whether paid or payable or distributed\nor distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or\notherwise, but determined without regard to any additional\npayments required under this paragraph 15) (a \"Payment\") would be\nsubject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or\nany interest or penalties are incurred by the Employee with\nrespect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any\nsuch interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively\nreferred to as the \"Excise Tax\"), then the Employee shall be\nentitled to receive an additional payment (a \"Gross-Up Payment\")\nin an amount such that after payment by the Employee of all taxes\n(including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such\ntaxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any\ninterest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise\nTax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Employee retains an\namount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed\nupon the Payments.\n\n(b)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 15(c), all determinations\nrequired to be made under this paragraph 15, including whether\nand when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such\nGross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving\nat such determination, shall be made by KPMG Peat Marwick LLP or\nsuch other certified public accounting firm as may be designated\nby the Employee (the \"Accounting Firm\") which shall provide\ndetailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the\nEmployee within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from\nthe Employee that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time\nas is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nFirm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual,\nentity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Employee\nshall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to\nmake the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm\nshall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All\nfees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by\nthe Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this\nparagraph 15 shall be paid by the Company to the Employee within\nfive days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination.\nAny determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon\nthe Company and the Employee. As a result of the uncertainty in\nthe application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the\ninitial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is\npossible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by\nthe Company should have been made (\"Underpayment\"), consistent\nwith the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event\nthat the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph\n15(c) and the Employee thereafter is required to make a payment\nof any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount\nof the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment\nshall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of\nthe Employee.\n\n(c)  The Employee shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by\nthe Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require\nthe payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such\nnotification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later\nthan ten business days after the Employee is informed in writing\nof such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such\nclaim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid.\nThe Employee shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of\nthe 30-day period following the date on which it gives such\nnotice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date\nthat any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If\nthe Company notifies the Employee in writing prior to the\nexpiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim,\nthe Employee shall:\n\n(1)  give the Company any information reasonably requested by the\nCompany relating to such claim,\n\n(2)  take such action in connection with contesting such claim as\nthe Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to\ntime, including, without limitation, accepting legal\nrepresentation with respect to such claim by an attorney\nreasonably selected by the Company,\n\n(3)  cooperate with the Company in good faith in order\neffectively to contest such claim, and\n\n(4)  permit the Company to participate in any proceedings\nrelating to such claim;\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nprovided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly\nall costs and expenses (including additional interest and\npenalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall\nindemnify and hold the Employee harmless, on an after-tax basis,\nfor any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and\npenalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such\nrepresentation and payment of costs and expenses. Without\nlimitation of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 15(c),\nthe Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection\nwith such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego\nany and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and\nconferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim\nand may, at its sole option, either direct the Employee to pay\nthe tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any\npermissible manner, and the Employee agrees to prosecute such\ncontest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in\na court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate\ncourts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that\nif the Company directs the Employee to pay such claim and sue for\na refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to\nthe Employee, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and\nhold the Employee harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any\nExcise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with\nrespect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with\nrespect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and\nfurther provided that any extension of the statute of limitations\nrelating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Employee\nwith respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due\nis limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the\nCompany's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with\nrespect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder\nand the Employee shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the\ncase may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue\nService or any other taxing authority.\n\n(d)  If, after the receipt by the Employee of an amount advanced by\nthe Company pursuant to Paragraph 15(c), the Employee becomes\nentitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the\nEmployee shall (subject to the Company's complying with the\nrequirements of Paragraph 15(c)) promptly pay to the Company the\namount of such refund (together with any interest paid or\ncredited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the\nreceipt by the Employee of an amount advanced by the Company\npursuant to Paragraph 15(c), a determination is made that the\nEmployee shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such\nclaim and the Company does not notify the Employee in writing of\nits intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the\nexpiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance\nshall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the\namount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the\namount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n16. Payment of Certain Costs of Employee. If a dispute arises regarding the\ninterpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, all legal fees and expenses\nincurred by the Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit\nprovided for in this Agreement or in otherwise pursuing his claim will be paid\nby the Company, to the extent permitted by law. The Company further agrees to\npay prejudgment interest on any money judgment obtained by the Employee\ncalculated at the First National Bank of Chicago N.A. prime interest rate in\neffect from time to time from the date that payment(s) to him should have been\nmade under this Agreement.\n\n17.

The Company shall\n(a) during the Employment Period and thereafter without limitation of time,\nindemnify and advance expenses to the Employee to the fullest extent permitted\nby the laws of the State of Nevada from time to time in effect and (b) during\nthe Employment Period, acquire and maintain directors and offices liability\ninsurance covering the Employee (and to the extent the Company desires, other\ndirectors and officers of the Company and its affiliated companies) to the\nextent it is available at commercially reasonable rates as determined by the\nBoard; provided, however, that in no event shall the Employee be entitled to\nindemnification or advancement of expenses under this Paragraph 17 with respect\nto any proceeding, or matter therein, brought or made by the Employee against\nthe Company other than one initiated by the Employee to enforce the Employee's\nadvancement of expenses as provided in this Paragraph 17 shall not be deemed\nexclusive of any other rights to which the Employee may at any time be entitled\nunder applicable law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company,\nany agreement, a vote of stockholders, a resolution of the Board, or otherwise.\nThe provisions of this Paragraph 17 shall continue in effect notwithstanding\ntermination of the Employee's employment hereunder for any reason, including,\nwithout limitation, Employee's voluntary termination. In furtherance thereof,\nand not by way of limitation, the Company shall reimburse Employee for all\nreasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Employee in connection with\nEmployee's obtaining and enforcing any right or benefit provided by this\nAgreement. The reimbursement of such legal fees and expenses shall be made\nwithin 30 days after Employee's request for payment accompanied by evidence of\nthe fees and expenses incurred.

Currently, after meeting the\neligibility requirements for age and actual service, \"awarded service\" is\nincluded in the calculation of the benefit under the Plan. This benefit\nis then offset by any retirement income expected from any previous\nemployers.\n\nAs you were advised earlier, MSBP is currently under review. Any changes\nwould affect you as they would apply to those similarly situated to\nyourself.\n\n-  You will be eligible to participate in our annual incentive plan. The\nplan as currently being developed provides for a target annual bonus of\n0% to 30% of salary adjusted for performance with a potential award of\n60%.\n\n\n\n< PAGE>   2\n\n\nMr. Theodore J.

In addition, as a Vice President, you will receive a\nchange-in-control severance arrangement.\n\n-  Currently, to be eligible for retiree health care, you must work at least\n15 years beyond age 40. To be eligible under the current plan, you would\nbe required to work until age 62. Should you elect to terminate\nemployment before incurring 15 years of service but after reaching age\n60, the Company will pay you a lump sum amount equivalent to the present\nvalue of the cost of your securing a health care policy (such as may be\nsecured through Blue Cross Blue Shield) to age 65.

We\nfeel your experience and talents will be of great value to NIKE.  As\nnow decided, your employment will commence on Monday, July 16, 2007.\n\nWe are offering you an annualized salary of $625,000 which will be paid\non a bi-weekly basis.\n\nWe are also offering you a sign-on bonus of $750,000 which will be\nissued with your first paycheck.  Bonus payments are subject to the\nappropriate withholdings and deductions.\n\nAs a Nike employee, you will participate in the Performance Sharing\nPlan (PSP).  PSP is a bonus program based upon a percentage of your\neligible paid fiscal year earnings (June 1 - May 31), and is\ndistributed in August of each year if we achieve our Pre-Tax Income\ngoals for the year.  The target PSP percentage for this position is\n70%.  This incentive bonus will vary based upon company performance.\nIf extraordinary performance is achieved, you can earn up to 150% of\nyour target award.\n\nSubject to approval by the Nike, Inc. Compensation Committee of the\nBoard of Directors, and to the terms of Nike's 1990 Stock Incentive\nPlan, as it may be amended from time to time, Nike will grant you an\ninitial \"sign-on\" option to purchase 50,000 shares of Nike, Inc. Class\nB Common Stock with an exercise price equal to the closing market price\non the date of grant.  The option will vest 25 percent per year, and\nhave a ten year term.  The effective date of the grant will coincide\nwith the first Compensation Committee meeting following commencement of\nyour employment, now scheduled for July 20, 2007.\n\nSubject to approval by the Nike, Inc. Compensation Committee and to the\nterms of Nike's 1990 Stock Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from\ntime to time, Nike will also grant you $1,000,000 worth of Nike, Inc.\nClass B Common Stock, which shall be \"restricted.\" These restricted\nshares will vest at the rate of one-third per year over the three years\nfollowing the date of grant.  Under normal circumstances the\nrestrictions on these shares will lapse ratably over three years;\nhowever, in the event Nike terminates your employment without cause\nwithin the first three years of employment, the restrictions will lapse\nand any unvested shares will vest upon termination.  The effective date\nof the grant will coincide with the first Compensation Committee\nmeeting following commencement of your employment, now scheduled for\nJuly 20, 2007.\n\nOn the first company-wide general stock and stock option grant date\nfollowing commencement of your employment, which as noted above will\ncoincide with the July 20, 2007 meeting of the Compensation Committee,\nNike will grant you an option to purchase 33,000 shares of Nike, Inc.\nClass B Common Stock with an exercise price equal to the closing price\non the date of grant.

Compensation Committee, and the terms of the\nNike, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to\ntime.\n\nAlso on July 20, 2007, Nike shall grant you $500,000 worth of Nike,\nInc. Class B Common Stock, which shall be \"restricted.\"  These\nrestricted shares shall be in addition to the \"sign-on\" restricted\nshares referenced above and in this case vest at the rate of one-half\nper year over the two years following the date of grant.\n\nYou will be eligible to participate in Nike's Long Term Incentive Plan\n(LTIP).  The LTIP is designed to reward you based on Nike's Revenue and\nEarnings Per Share performance over a three-year period.

Plan awards are made in cash at the end of the\nthree-year performance period.\n\nAs a Vice President, your target award will be $300,000. Since you are\njoining Nike mid-way in some Plan years, your target award would\nnormally be pro-rated for Fiscal Years '08 and '09.    However, you\nwill be paid an additional cash bonus each year beginning with the FY08\nplan as if you had been a full participant in each of the three years\nof the plan (see chart below).\n\n3-Year Performance      Normal Target      Award Target Award after\nPeriod          Award if Start July    Special Make-up Bonus\n\n\nFY08 LTIP  FY06, FY07, FY08         $100,000                 $300,000\n\nFY09 LTIP  FY07, FY08, FY09         $200,000                 $300,000\n\nFY10 LTIP  FY08, FY09, FY10         $300,000                 $300,000\n(no pro-ration)\n\n\nYou will be eligible for corporate benefits starting the first day of\nthe month following 30 days of employment.

You become vested in your Profit Sharing\nAccount based on years of service and are fully vested after five\nyears.\n\nDeferred Compensation Plan (DCP)\n________________________________\n\nYou are eligible to contribute to the DCP.

The Prior Expired Options were inadvertently extended to December 31, 2015, however, due to an 8 year life limitation\nunder the Company’s Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Equity Plan”), they were deemed canceled at the end\nof 8 years. Moreover, the Equity Plan only permits the grant of a total of 2,000,000 stock options during any calendar year. Mr.\nKramer had exceeded this limit during the 2014 year and as a result, the Company was only able to grant Mr. Kramer 1,150,000 stock\noptions during the 2014 year as partial replacement for the 2,000,000 Prior Expired Options.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe foregoing\nsummaries of the Adams Executive Agreement, the Adams Option, and the Kramer Option are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the full text of the agreements that are filed as exhibits to this current report and incorporated herein\nby this reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 9 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS\n\n\n\n\n\nItem 9.01.

Williamson, the\nChief Executive Officer of the Company (the “Executive”) on October 18, 2002; and\nWHEREAS, effective August 17, 2005,\nthe Employment Agreement was amended to change the period prior to expiration of the Employment Agreement within which either party could give notice that it did not consent to the automatic renewal of the Employment Agreement for one year at the\nend of its initial three year term; and\nWHEREAS, effective September 15, 2005, the Employment Agreement was further amended to extend\nthe term of the Employment Agreement through October 2006, and to modify the period during which options to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) may be exercised in certain circumstances; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Company and Executive are concerned that the amendments to the Employment Agreement may be deemed a modification of the terms\nof the options referenced in the Employment Agreement and therefore such options might be treated as “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (“Section 409A”); and\n\nWHEREAS, it is the intent of the Company and Executive that the referenced options not be subject to Section 409A or that such options be\ncompliant with Section 409A while preserving for the parties the economics of the Employment Agreement and other compensatory elements of the relationship between the Company and the Executive; and\nNOW, THEREFORE, the Company and Executive hereby agree to the following terms as reasonable good faith compliance with Section 409A on this 16th day\nof March, 2006:\n\n\nI.\tAMENDMENT OF THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT\n\nThe Employment\nAgreement is hereby amended according to the terms of the Third Amendment in the form attached hereto as Appendix A.\n\n\nII.\tCANCELLATION OF EXISTING STOCK OPTIONS\n\nThe outstanding\nvested and nonvested options to purchase shares of Common Stock identified in Appendix B that were previously granted to the Executive by the Company and are presently outstanding (individually the “Option” and collectively the\n“Options”) are hereby terminated and are null and void effective as of the date hereof.\n\n\nIII.\tAWARD OF NEW 2006 OPTION\n\n\n\nA.\t Valuation of Cancelled Unvested and Partially Unvested Options. The Black-Scholes value (“Black-Scholes Value”) of all Options (as\nidentified in Appendix C) has been calculated based on the fair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmarket value of a share of Common Stock, as determined under the Dynegy Inc. 2002 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), as of the date hereof (the\n“Fair Market Value”) and such other assumptions set forth on Appendix C.\n\n\n\n\nB.\tAward of New Stock Option. Pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the Option Agreement attached hereto as Appendix D, the Company shall grant Executive\neffective as of the date hereof (the “Grant Date”) a new option to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock with a Black-Scholes Value equal to the Black-Scholes Value of the Options (the “2006 Option”), less the Intrinsic\nValue of the vested portion of the Options as described in Paragraph IV.A of the Employment Agreement. The price at which a share of Common Stock may be purchased upon exercise of the 2006 Option shall equal the Fair Market Value as of the date\nof grant. The number of shares to be granted and the exercise price of the 2006 Option are set forth in the Option Agreement attached as Appendix D.\n\n\n\nIV.\tCASH PAYMENT TO EXECUTIVE\n\n\n\nA.\tDeferred Cash Payment. The Company shall pay the Executive a single cash lump sum payment on January 15, 2007 of $5,565,187, which is equal to the difference\nbetween the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to vested Options as identified in Appendix E on the Grant Date less the exercise price of such Options (the “Intrinsic Value”), with interest on such difference from the\ndate hereof until January 15, 2007, at the rate of 7.50% (the prime rate as of the date hereof), compounded monthly.\n\n\n\nV.\tSECTION 409A COMPLIANCE\n\n\n\nA.\tThe parties intend for this arrangement to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations and Treasury pronouncements\n(“Section 409A”). If the parties determine that any provision provided herein or in the Employment Agreement results in the imposition of an excise tax under the provisions of Section 409A, the Executive and the Company agree that\neach will use good faith efforts to reform any such provision to avoid imposition of any such excise tax in the manner that the Executive and the Company mutually determine are appropriate to comply with Section 409A.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date hereof.\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE\n\n/s/ Bruce A.

Pursuant Agreement, Mr. Paz’s\nprevious employment agreement with the Company, entered into in April 2004 (the\n“2004 Agreement”) with Mr. Paz was terminated other than those terms addressing\nthe stock option and restricted stock grants under the 2004 Agreement, which\nterms were incorporated by reference into the Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nThe\nAgreement was effective as of April 1, 2005 with an initial term through March\n31, 2008. The Agreement provides for (i) an initial base salary of $650,000\n(which may not be reduced after any increase); (ii) a guaranteed minimum annual\nbonus target under the Company’s bonus plan of 100% of Mr. Paz’s annual base\nsalary, with a bonus opportunity for each calendar year during the employment\nperiod of up to 200% of the executive’s guaranteed minimum annual bonus in the\nevent the Company achieves certain “stretch” financial and work plan goals;\n(iii) participation in the Company’s benefit and incentive plans and other\narrangements in accordance with their terms; (iv) the crediting of a deferred\nbonus in the amount of $200,000 to the executive’s retirement account in the\nCompany’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the “EDCP”), subject to the\nterms and conditions of the EDCP, which bonus generally vests at the end of the\ninitial employment period except as described below; (v) a grant under the\nCompany’s 2000 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2000 LTIP”) of an option to\npurchase 40,000 shares of the Common Stock, vesting in three equal increments on\nMarch 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008; and (vi) such perquisites and fringe\nbenefits to which similarly situated Company executives are entitled and which\nare suitable for Mr. Paz’s position.\n\n\n\n\nIf Mr.\nPaz’s employment is terminated prior to expiration of the employment period, he\nis not entitled to receive any further payments or benefits that have not\nalready been paid or provided (including any unvested portion of the option\ngrant or restricted stock award) except as follows:\n\n\n\n\nMr.\nPaz will be entitled to all previously earned and accrued, but unpaid,\nannual base salary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf\nMr. Paz’s employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or\nDisability, or by Mr. Paz for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in\nthe Agreement), Mr. Paz is entitled to receive: (i) a pro rata portion of\nthe restricted stock award under the 2004 Agreement based on the number of\ndays worked during the employment period under the 2004 Agreement; (ii) a\nseverance benefit equal to 18 months of his base salary plus a specified\nportion of his bonus potential for the year based on the average\npercentage of the potential earned for the three prior years; (iii)\nreimbursement for the cost of continuing medical insurance for Mr. Paz,\nhis spouse and any eligible dependents for 36 months after termination of\nemployment; and (iv) a pro rata portion of the deferred bonus based on the\nnumber of days worked during the initial employment\nperiod.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf\nMr. Paz’s employment terminates on account of Disability or retirement\n(i.e., voluntary retirement on or after age 59 ½ but not within 90 days\nafter a change in control (as defined in the Agreement) of the Company)\nprior to the end of his employment period under the Agreement, Mr. Paz\ngenerally is entitled to receive (i) a certain percentage of the\nrestricted stock award calculated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,\n(ii) a pro rata portion of the deferred bonus, and (iii) reimbursement for\nthe cost of continuing medical insurance for Mr. Paz, his spouse and any\neligible dependents for 36 months after termination of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf\nMr. Paz’s employment terminates on account of death prior to the end of\nhis employment period under the Agreement, Mr. Paz’s estate generally is\nentitled to receive (i) 100% of the restricted stock award calculated\npursuant to the terms of the Agreement, (ii) 100% of the deferred bonus,\nand (iii) reimbursement for the cost of continuing medical insurance for\nMr. Paz’ spouse and any eligible dependents for 36 months after\ntermination of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Mr.\nPaz’s employment is terminated prior to expiration of the employment period\n(including any renewal period in effect) for any reason, then he is prohibited\nfrom competing against the Company for 18 months after such termination. If\ntermination of employment occurs solely as a result of expiration of the\nAgreement, Mr. Paz is prohibited from competing for one year after such\ntermination. Mr. Paz is also subject to certain non-solicitation and\nnon-disclosure limitations. Entitlement to the severance benefit described above\n(including any prorated portion) is contingent upon compliance with these\nrestrictive covenants. The parties also agreed that in the event any severance\nor similar payments to be made to Mr. Paz following termination (other than\npayments under the EDCP) should be subject to the restrictions of Section 409A\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the parties would\nnegotiate in good faith to amend the Agreement to the extent necessary to create\npayment terms with respect to such post-termination payments which are as close\nas possible to those originally set forth in the Agreement while not violating\nthe terms of Section 409A.\n\n\n\nIn the\nevent that any amount or benefit paid or distributed to Mr. Paz pursuant to the\nAgreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or\ndistributed to the executive by the Company pursuant to any other arrangement or\nplan (collectively, the “Covered Payments”), would result in the executive’s\nliability for the payment of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal\nRevenue Code (or any similar state or local tax) (collectively, the “Excise\nTax”), the Company will make a “gross-up” payment to the executive to fully\noffset the Excise Tax provided the aggregate present value of the Covered\nPayments is equal to or exceeds 125% of the maximum total payment which could be\nmade to the executive without triggering the Excise Tax. If the aggregate\npresent value of the Covered Payments, however, exceeds such maximum amount, but\nis less than 125% of such maximum amount, then the Company may, in its\ndiscretion, reduce the Covered Payments so that no portion of the Covered\nPayments is subject to the Excise Tax, and no gross-up payment will be\nmade.\n\n\n\nItem\n1.02 Termination\nof Material Definitive Agreement\n\n\n\n\nIn\nconnection with entering into the agreement with Mr. Paz described in Item 1.01\nabove, the Company and Mr. Paz terminated the 2004 Agreement entered into on\nApril 15, 2004 between the Company and Mr. Paz. A brief description of the terms\nand conditions of such employment agreement was provided in the Company’s Proxy\nStatement on Schedule 14A filed on April 16, 2004, which description is\nincorporated herein by reference.

In\nthis letter I would like to present the terms of your employment with ISCO.\n\nYour salary will be $175,000 per year, earned and paid on ISCO’s regular payroll cycle. You will be eligible for a cash bonus of up to 25% of your annual salary, based on the achievement of mutually agreed upon goals. You will remain\neligible to participate in the February 2006 payouts of the incentive cash and equity programs. Subject to Board approval, I anticipate those totals to be $15,000 in cash bonus and a grant of 250,000 shares of ISCO common stock.\n\nWe will recommend to our Board of Directors that you be granted restricted common stock in\nthe amount of 250,000 shares in 2006, to vest on a quarterly basis over two years.

In addition to the benefits described above, Employee shall be entitled to the fringe benefits regularly enjoyed by other full time employees of the Company and its affiliates (including without limitation, health, dental and life insurance coverage), and the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the terms and conditions of Employee's employment shall not prevent Employee from participating in any other compensation or benefit program adopted by the Company solely because such programs are not specifically mentioned in this Agreement.  Employee shall pay any required employee contribution for the plans in which Employee participates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nAt-Will Employment, Confidential Information,\n\n\n\n\n\nInvention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Company terminates Employee without Cause (as defined below), Employee shall be entitled to: (i) any Base Salary earned but not yet paid, plus two months of Base Salary as severance pay (\"Severance Pay\"); (ii) reimbursement of any unpaid business expenses incurred in accordance with his/her employment by Employee prior to the effective date of the termination of Employee's employment; and (iii) any other benefits accrued and vested through the date of such termination in accordance with the applicable plans and programs of the Company.  Employee shall execute and deliver to the Company a Separation Agreement and Release in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company as a condition of entitlement to any payments following termination of employment pursuant to this Section.  \"Cause\" shall mean (i) the Employee's conviction of, or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, (ii) any intentional or willful misappropriation by the Employee of funds or property of the Company or its affiliates, (iii) any violation by the Employee of the terms of any covenant not to compete or confidentiality agreement with respect to the Company, (iv) any material failure of the Employee that is intentional or willful, or any material refusal of the Employee, to perform the duties reasonably assigned to him, or (v) any other intentional, fraudulent or gross misconduct by the Employee which is demonstrably injurious to the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Information.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.           Company Information.  I agree at all times during the term of my employment and thereafter for two (2) years, to hold in strictest confidence, and not to use, except for the benefit of the Company, or to disclose to any person, firm or corporation without written authorization of the management of the Company, any Confidential Information of the Company, except under a non-disclosure agreement duly authorized and executed by the Company.  I understand that “Confidential Information” means any non-public information that relates to the actual or anticipated business or research and development of the Company, technical data, trade secrets or know-how, including, but not limited to, research, product plans or other information regarding the Company’s products or services and markets therefor, customer lists and customers (including, but not limited to, customers of the Company on whom I called or with whom I became acquainted during the term of my employment), software, developments, inventions, processes, formulas, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing, finances or other business information.  I further understand that Confidential Information does not include any of the foregoing items which have become publicly known and made generally available through no wrongful act of mine or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to the item or items involved or improvements or new versions thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nAt-Will Employment, Confidential Information,\n\n\n\n\n\nInvention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB.           Former Employer Information.  I agree that I will not, during my employment with the Company, improperly use or disclose any proprietary information or trade secrets of any former or concurrent employer or other person or entity and that I will not bring onto the premises of the Company any unpublished document or proprietary information belonging to any such employer, person or entity unless consented to in writing by such employer, person or entity.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.           Third Party Information.  I recognize that the Company has received and in the future will receive from third parties their confidential or proprietary information subject to a duty on the Company’s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes.  I agree to hold all such confidential or proprietary information in the strictest confidence and not to disclose it to any person, firm or corporation or to use it except as necessary in carrying out my work for the Company consistent with the Company’s agreement with such third party.\n\n\n\n\n\nInventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nD.           Inventions Retained and Licensed.  I have attached hereto, as Exhibit A, a list describing all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, improvements, and trade secrets which were made by me prior to my employment with the Company (collectively referred to as “Prior Inventions”), which belong to me, which relate to the Company’s proposed business, products or research and development, and which are not assigned to the Company hereunder; or, if no such list is attached, I represent that there are no such Prior Inventions.  If in the course of my employment with the Company, I incorporate into a Company product, process or service a Prior Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest, I hereby grant to the Company a nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Prior Invention as part of or in connection with such product, process or service, and to practice any method related thereto.\n\n\n\n\n\nE.           Assignment of Inventions.  I agree that I will promptly make full written disclosure to the Company, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and hereby assign to the Company, or its designee, all my right, title, and interest in and to any and all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, improvements, designs, discoveries, ideas, trademarks or trade secrets, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar laws, which I may solely or jointly conceive or develop or reduce to practice, or cause to be conceived or developed or reduced to practice, during the entire period of time I am in the employ of the Company (whether before or after the execution of this Agreement) (collectively referred to as “Inventions”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nAt-Will Employment, Confidential Information,\n\n\n\n\n\nInvention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI further acknowledge that all original works of authorship which are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of my employment with the Company (whether before or after the execution of this Agreement) and which are protectible by copyright are “works made for hire,” as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act.  Employee understands that this means that the Company will have the right to undertake any of the actions set forth in section 106 of the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 106) with respect to such copyrightable works prepared by Employee within the scope of Employee’s employment.  Employee understands that this includes, without limitation, the right to sell, license, use, reproduce and have reproduced, create derivative works of, distribute, display, transmit and otherwise commercially exploit such copyrightable works by all means without further compensating the Employee.  I understand and agree that the decision whether or not to commercialize or market any invention developed by me solely or jointly with others is within the Company’s sole discretion and for the Company’s sole benefit and that no royalty will be due to me as a result of the Company’s efforts to commercialize or market any such invention.\n\n\n\n\n\nF.           Assignment of Other Rights.  In addition to the foregoing assignment of Inventions to the Company, Employee hereby irrevocably transfers and assigns to the Company: (i) all worldwide patents, patent applications, copyrights, mask works, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights in any Assigned Inventions; and (ii) any and all “Moral Rights” (as defined below) that Employee may have in or with respect to any Inventions.  Employee also hereby forever waives and agrees never to assert any and all Moral Rights Employee may have in or with respect to any Inventions, even after termination of Employee’s work on behalf of the Company.  “Moral Rights” means any rights to claim authorship of any Inventions, to object to or prevent the modification of any Inventions, or to withdraw from circulation or control the publication or distribution of any Inventions, and any similar right, existing under judicial or statutory law of any country in the world, or under any treaty, regardless of whether or not such right is denominated or generally referred to as a “moral right”.\n\n\n\n\n\nG.           Inventions Assigned to the United States.  I agree to assign to the United States government all my right, title, and interest in and to any and all Inventions whenever such full title is required to be in the United States by a contract between the Company and the United States or any of its agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nH.           Maintenance of Records.  I agree to keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Inventions made by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of my employment with the Company.  The records will be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, and any other format that may be specified by the Company.  The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 4 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nAt-Will Employment, Confidential Information,\n\n\n\n\n\nInvention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI.           Patent and Copyright Registrations.  I agree to assist the Company, or its designee, at the Company’s expense, in every proper way to secure the Company’s rights in the Inventions and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments and all other instruments which the Company shall deem necessary in order to apply for and obtain such rights and in order to assign and convey to the Company, its successors, assigns, and nominees the sole and exclusive rights, title and interest in and to such Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto.  I further agree that my obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue after the termination of this Agreement.  If the Company is unable because of my mental or physical incapacity or for any other reason to secure my signature to apply for or to pursue any application for any United States or foreign patents or copyright registrations covering Inventions or original works of authorship assigned to the Company as above, then I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent or copyright registrations thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me.\n\n\n\n\n\nConflicting Employment.  I agree that, during the term of my employment with the Company, I will not engage in any other employment, occupation or consulting directly related to the business in which the Company is now involved or becomes involved during the term of my employment, nor will I engage in any other activities that conflict with my obligations to the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning Company Documents.  I agree that, at the time of leaving the employ of the Company, I will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in my possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, materials, equipment, other documents or property, or reproductions of any aforementioned items developed by me pursuant to my employment with the Company or otherwise belonging to the Company, its successors or assigns, including, without limitation, those records maintained pursuant to Section 3.E.  In the event of the termination of my employment, I agree to sign and deliver the “Termination Certification” attached hereto as Exhibit B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nAt-Will Employment, Confidential Information,\n\n\n\n\n\nInvention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotification of New Employer.  In the event that I leave the employ of the Company, I hereby grant consent to notification by the Company to my new employer about my rights and obligations under this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolicitation of Employees.  I agree that for a period of six (6) months immediately following the termination of my relationship with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, I will not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company’s employees to leave their employment or the Company’s customers to remove or reduce their business with the Company, or take away such employees or customers, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or customers of the Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity.\n\n\n\n\n\nConflict of Interest Guidelines.  I agree to diligently adhere to the Conflict of Interest Guidelines attached as Exhibit C hereto.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentations.  I agree to execute any proper oath or verify any proper document required to carry out the terms of this Agreement.  I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to my employment by the Company.  I hereby represent and warrant that I have not entered into, and I will not enter into, any oral or written agreement in conflict herewith.\n\n\n\n\n\nArbitration and Equitable Relief.\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.           Arbitration.  In consideration of my employment with the Company, its promise to arbitrate all employment-related disputes and my receipt of the compensation, pay raises and other benefits paid to me by the Company, at present and in the future, I agree that any and all controversies, claims, or disputes with anyone (including the Company and any employee, officer, director, stockholder or benefit plan of the Company in their capacity as such or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or resulting from my employment with the Company or the termination of my employment with the Company, including any breach of this Agreement, will be subject to binding arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Disputes which I agree to arbitrate, and thereby agree to waive any right to a trial by jury, include any statutory claims under state or federal law, including, but not limited to, claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, claims of harassment, discrimination or wrongful termination and any statutory claims. I further understand that this agreement to arbitrate also applies to any disputes that the Company may have with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 6 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nAt-Will Employment, Confidential Information,\n\n\n\n\n\nInvention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK.           Procedure.  I agree that any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and that the neutral arbitrator will be selected in a manner consistent with its national rules for the resolution of employment disputes. I agree that the arbitrator will have the power to decide any motions brought by any party to the arbitration, including motions for summary judgment and/or adjudication and motions to dismiss and demurrers, prior to any arbitration hearing.  I also agree that the arbitrator will have the power to award any remedies, including attorneys' fees and costs, available under applicable law.  I understand the Company will pay for any administrative or hearing fees charged by the arbitrator or AAA except that I will pay the first $200.00 of any filing fees associated with any arbitration I initiate. I agree that the arbitrator will administer and conduct any arbitration in a manner consistent with AAA's national rules, to the extent that the AAA's national rules for the resolution of employment disputes do not conflict with applicable law.  I agree that the decision of the arbitrator will be in writing.\n\n\n\n\n\nL.           Remedy.  Except as provided by law and this Agreement, arbitration will be the sole, exclusive and final remedy for any dispute between me and the Company.  Accordingly, except as provided for by law and this Agreement, neither I nor the Company will be permitted to pursue court action regarding claims that are subject to arbitration.  Notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have the authority to disregard or refuse to enforce any lawful Company policy, and the arbitrator will not order or require the Company to adopt a policy not otherwise required by law which the Company has not adopted.\n\n\n\n\n\nM.           Availability of Injunctive Relief.  In addition to any right under applicable law that the Company or I may have to petition a court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, I agree that any party may also petition the arbitrator for provisional injunctive relief where either party alleges or claims a violation of the employment, confidential information, invention assignment agreement between me and the Company or any other agreement regarding trade secrets, confidential information, or non-solicitation.  I understand that any breach or threatened breach of such an agreement will cause irreparable injury and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy therefor and both parties hereby consent to the issuance of an injunction.  In the event either party seeks injunctive relief, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorneys' fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 7 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nAt-Will Employment, Confidential Information,\n\n\n\n\n\nInvention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.           Administrative Relief.  I understand that this Agreement does not prohibit me from pursuing an administrative claim with a local, state or federal administrative body.  This Agreement does, however, preclude me from pursuing court action regarding any such claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nO.           Voluntary Nature of Agreement.  I acknowledge and agree that I am executing this Agreement voluntarily and without any duress or undue influence by the Company or anyone else.  I further acknowledge and agree that I have carefully read this Agreement and that I have asked any questions needed for me to understand the terms, consequences and binding effect of this Agreement and fully understand it, including that I AM WAIVING MY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.  Finally, I agree that I have been provided an opportunity to seek the advice of an attorney of my choice before signing this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Provisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nP.           Governing Law, Consent to Personal Jurisdiction.  This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas.  I hereby expressly consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Texas for any lawsuit filed there against me by the Company arising from or relating to this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.           Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, along with the Retention and Noncompetition Agreement and the offer letter of employment (if any), sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and me relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior discussions or representations between us including, but not limited to, any representations made during my interview(s) or relocation negotiations, whether written or oral.  No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing signed by an authorized officer of the Company (other than me) and me.  Any subsequent change or changes in my duties, salary or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.  This Agreement prevails and supersedes in the event there is any inconsistency between this Agreement and any other offer letter, unless the offer letter expressly provides otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nR.           Severability.  If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void by law, then the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 8 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\nAt-Will Employment, Confidential Information,\n\n\n\n\n\nInvention Assignment, and Arbitration

Vertex Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”) to conduct its affairs in strict compliance with the letter and spirit of the law and to adhere to the highest principles of business ethics.  Accordingly, all officers, employees and independent contractors must avoid activities which are in conflict, or give the appearance of being in conflict, with these principles and with the interests of the Company.  The following are potentially compromising situations which must be avoided.  Any exceptions must be reported to an authorized officer of the Company (other than me) and written approval for continuation must be obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.           Revealing confidential information to outsiders or misusing confidential information.  Unauthorized divulging of information is a violation of this policy whether or not for personal gain and whether or not harm to the Company is intended.  (The At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment and Arbitration Agreement elaborates on this principle and is binding).\n\n\n\n\n\nAccepting or offering substantial gifts, excessive entertainment, favors or payments which may be deemed to constitute undue influence or otherwise be improper or embarrassing to the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipating in civic or professional organizations that might involve divulging confidential information of the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitiating or approving personnel actions affecting reward or punishment of employees or applicants where there is a family relationship or is or appears to be a personal or social involvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitiating or approving any form of personal or social harassment of employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting or holding outside directorship in suppliers, customers, or competing companies, including financial speculations, where such investment or directorship might influence in any manner a decision or course of action of the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorrowing from or lending to employees, customers or suppliers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquiring real estate of interest to the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproperly using or disclosing to the Company any proprietary information or trade secrets of any former or concurrent employer or other person or entity with whom obligations of confidentiality exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlawfully discussing prices, costs, customers, sales or markets with competing companies or their employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking any unlawful agreement with distributors with respect to prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproperly using or authorizing the use of any inventions which are the subject of patent claims of any other person or entity.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngaging in any conduct which is not in the best interest of the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach officer, employee and independent contractor must take every necessary action to ensure compliance with these guidelines and to bring problem areas to the attention of higher management for review.  Violations of this conflict of interest policy may result in discharge without warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2","annotation":null,"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1554189350000,"last_updated_at":1554189350000,"sec_taken":0,"last_updated_by":"izZDlcm2gHZ86p8XKDKOMo9hqZT2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

The Cleys Employment Agreement provides for, among other things, a salary of $250,000 per year, subject to yearly review, plus a bonus opportunity based upon Mr. Cleys' performance and the attainment of management objectives of up to $15,000 per quarter. If Mr. Cleys' employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause or disability during the period of his employment agreement, or Mr. Cleys terminates his employment for good reason during the period of his employment agreement, then he will receive a severance package which includes, among other things: (1) his salary earned through the date of termination (to the extent not already paid); (2) the product of (x) the annual bonus paid or payable, including any bonus or portion thereof which has been ear\nned but deferred, for the most recently completed fiscal year during the employment period and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the current fiscal year through the date of termination, and the denominator of which is 365; (3) any compensation previously deferred by Mr. Cleys (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) to the extent not theretofore paid; and (4) an amount equal to a designated multiple (the \"Cleys Severance Multiple\") times the highest combined annual salary and bonus earned by Mr. Cleys from the Company, including any such amounts earned but deferred, in the last three fiscal years prior to the date of termination. The Cleys Severance Multiple shall be the greater of (a) one, (b) the number of full months remaining between the date of termination and June 30, 2008, divided by 12, or (c) two, if the date of termination occurs within 12 months after or otherwise in contemplation of a Change in Control, as defined in the Cleys Employment Agreement.  I\nn addition, for a number of months equal to the Cleys Severance Multiple following Mr. Cleys' date of termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company will continue benefits to Mr. Cleys and his dependents at least equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the welfare plans described in the Cleys Employment Agreement if Mr. Cleys' employment had not been terminated. Mr. Cleys' receipt of these benefits will be subject to his execution of a release of claims in the form customarily used by the Company upon termination of the employment of a senior executive officer.\n\n\nMr. Cleys has agreed in his employment agreement not to disclose or use confidential information or to compete with the Company, and not to solicit the Company's customers or recruit its employees, for a period of two years following the ter\nmination of his employment. On October 13, 2005, the Company entered into a new employment agreement (the \"Baur Employment Agreement\") with Michael L.

The Baur Severance Multiple shall be the greater of (a) one, (b) the number of full months remaining between the date of termination and June 30, 2008, divided by 12, or (c) three, if the date of termination occurs within 12 months after or otherwise in contemplation of a Change in Control, as defined in the Baur Employment Agreement.  In addition, Mr. Baur and his dependents will receive medical, dental and prescription drug benefits until Mr. Baur reaches the age of 65, and Mr. Baur will receive MediGap coverage, to the extent available, until Mr. Baur reaches the age of 80, which shall consist of ongoing coverage under policies that cover medical expenses for Mr. Baur an\nd his dependents in excess of that covered by Medicare, subject to certain limitations.

{"content": "Exhibit 10.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT 10.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 18, 2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan Hilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Joan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am pleased to offer you the position of Senior Vice President-Finance for American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. or its designated subsidiary (the \"Company\").  The following summarizes the terms and conditions of your employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition and Duties:  You will be employed as Senior Vice President-Finance, with such authority and duties as are customary for the position, and shall perform such other services and duties as the CEO or Board may from time to time designate.  It is our intent that, depending on your assimilation in our business, development and contributions, you should be promoted to the position of Chief Financial Officer of the Company within 12 to 18 months of the start of your employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Date:  Your first day of active employment for the Company will be on or before September 1, 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Base Salary: For our 2005 fiscal year, your base salary will be at an annual rate of $430,000.00 payable in accordance with Company's payroll practices for executive employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign-On Bonus and Replacement Bonus:  A one time sign-on cash bonus of $50,000.00 (before tax) will be paid to you within 30 days after your start date.  A sign-on bonus payback agreement is enclosed for your review and signature.  The Company will also pay you a one time bonus equal to the amount of your spring 2005 incentive bonus at your current employer, which you have indicated is up to 40% of your annual target bonus, upon your establishing to the Company's satisfaction the amount that you would have actually been paid for that bonus by your current employer if you had not accepted this offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Incentive Bonus:  For fiscal years after 2005, you will be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus targeted at 50% of your annual base salary in each fiscal year or other performance period established under Company's Management Incentive Plan\" (\"the Bonus Plan\"), with a maximum annual incentive bonus equal to 100% of your annual base salary. The Bonus Plan conditions the payment of this annual performance bonus based on achievement of pre-determined performance goals set forth in writing and based on objective measurements all established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the \"Committee\").  The Committee must verify that the performance goals and other material terms are met prior to payment.  It is the parties' intention that the Bonus Plan be adopted and administered in a manner that enables Company to\ndeduct for federal income tax purposes the amount of any annual incentive bonus.   Notwithstanding the forgoing, if your start date is on or before September 1, 2005, then your annual incentive bonus for fiscal 2005 will be targeted at 50% of your full annual base salary, or $215,000.00, based on Company EPS performance goals established by the Committee and conditioned on your continuous employment with the Company through the date in 2006 when executive fiscal 2005 annual incentive bonuses are paid, and you are not eligible for an annual incentive bonus above the targeted 50% amount for fiscal 2005 even if performance goals are achieved or exceeded.  If your start date is after September 1, 2005, then the amount of your annual incentive bonus for fiscal 2005 will be based on the prorated amount of your base salary actually paid to you in fiscal 2005 and not your full annual base salary of $430,000.00.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong Term Incentive Cash Plan.\nYou will be eligible to receive a long term incentive bonus under  the Bonus Plan (the \"LTI Plan\"), where an amount targeted at 25% of annual base salary and a maximum of 50% of base salary will be contributed to your LTI bonus account, conditioned on achievement of pre-determined performance goals set forth in writing and based on objective measurements all established by the Committee.  The Committee must verify that the performance goals and other material terms have been met prior to crediting the LTI bonus account.  You will receive payment of: (a) one-third of the amount in your LTI bonus account in each fiscal year beginning in fiscal 2008; (b) the entire amount in your LTI bonus account on death, disability or retirement; and (c) no amount of your LTI bonus account, which will be forfeited, on any voluntary termination of employment, unless specifically excepted by mutual agreement under the terms of the voluntary termination, and excluding amou\nnts earned and otherwise payable but deferred under the Company's deferred compensation plan.  It is the parties' intention that the LTI Plan be adopted and administered in a manner that enables the Company to deduct for federal income tax purposes all amounts paid pursuant to the LTI Plan.  If your start date is on or prior to September 1, 2005, then your LTI bonus calculation for fiscal 2005 will be targeted at 25% of your full year base salary or $107,500.00 and not a prorated portion of your base salary and you are not eligible for an annual incentive bonus above the targeted 25% amount for fiscal 2005 even if performance goals are achieved or exceeded.  If your start date is after September 1, 2005, then your LTI bonus calculation for fiscal 2005 will be based on a prorated portion of your full year base salary based on the actual amount of base salary paid to you in fiscal 2005.  No amount of your LTI bonus is guaranteed and the entire amount will depend on whether applicable performance goals are achi\neved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestricted Stock:  You will receive 7,000 shares of restricted stock in a grant made by the Committee pursuant to and subject to all terms and conditions set forth in Company's 2005 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (\"the 2005 Plan\"). Pursuant to the terms of the 2005 Plan, the Committee will condition the vesting of this restricted stock based on achievement of pre-determined performance goals set forth in writing and based on objective measurements all established by the Committee. The Committee must verify that the performance goals and other material terms are met prior to vesting.  If the performance goals are not met then the restricted stock will be forfeited.  It is the parties' intention that the 2005 Plan be adopted and administered in a manner that enables the Company to deduct for federal income tax purposes the full value of all restricted stock grants.  For fiscal 2005, your performance goals\nto earn the restricted stock will be individual performance goals, not Company goals, which 2005 Individual Performance Goals are attached to this letter and incorporated herein by reference.  The 7,000 shares will vest upon completion of the Individual Performance Goals, even if those goals are achieved after fiscal 2005 as a result of a later start date.  This grant of 7,000 shares is in addition to the equity award that you will be eligible to receive under the 2005 Plan for fiscal 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelocation:  You will be eligible for a full relocation package as outlined in the American Eagle Outfitter's, Inc. Relocation guide. (Relocation guide and payback agreement enclosed).  In addition, the Company will use the services of the Lexicon Company to provide you the opportunity to sell your existing home at an appraised value.  Please contact Lee Ann Rohan once you accept this offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefit Plans: You will be entitled to participate in employee benefit plans, including any profit sharing or 401(k) plans; group life, health, hospitalization and disability insurance plans; deferred compensation plans; discount privileges; and other employee welfare benefits made available generally to, and under the same terms as, the Company's other executives.  The Company will pay any COBRA premiums for continued coverage under your existing health plan until you are eligible for coverage under the Company's group health insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Will Employment:  The Company is an \"at will\" employer.  This means that you can terminate your employment at anytime and for any reason and the Company can also terminate your employment at any time and for any reason.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you accept this offer and are unable to begin active employment with the Company as a result of your non-competition agreement with your current employer, then the Company will pay you your base salary, replacement bonus and Cobra benefit for up to the six month period during which you are prevented from working for the Company; provided that you will cooperate with the Company at its expense and use your best efforts to resolve any such issue and further provided further that you shall provide such permissible services to the Company or any of its affiliates as the Company may direct during this interi\nm period.  The payment by the Company of your base salary during this period shall be reduced by any payment that you receive from your current employer pursuant to your non-competition agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidentiality, Non-competition and Intellectual Property Agreement: Your employment is conditioned upon your execution of the form of Confidentiality, Non-Competition and Intellectual Property Agreement in the form attached to this letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences/Drug Screen:  Your hiring and employment with American Eagle are contingent upon successful completion of your references and your submission to and\npassing of a pre-hire drug screen. If you begin work with American Eagle before your references are checked and/or before your drug screen occurs or American Eagle has received its results, and if either your reference check results are unacceptable or you refuse to submit to or fail to pass your pre-hire drug screen requirement, your contingent employment will be terminated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe very much look forward to you becoming a member of the American Eagle Outfitters team.  Please sign and date one copy of this letter and the attached agreements and return them to me  to indicate you understand and accept the terms; the additional copy is for your records.  Please let me know if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/s/ Laura Weil\n\n\n\n\nLaura Weil\nExecutive\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreed and accepted  as outlined above:\n\n\n\n\n\n/s/\nJoan Hilson\n7/20/05\n\nJoan Hilson\n\n\nDate","annotation":[{"label":["Name_employee"],"points":[{"start":10356,"end":10366,"text":"Joan Hilson"}]},{"label":["Name_employee"],"points":[{"start":10335,"end":10345,"text":"Joan Hilson"}]},{"label":["At_will_not"],"points":[{"start":7962,"end":7968,"text":"At Will"}]},{"label":["Health_insurance"],"points":[{"start":7548,"end":7601,"text":"health, hospitalization and disability insurance plans"}]},{"label":["Non_monetary_benefits"],"points":[{"start":7536,"end":7545,"text":"group life"}]},{"label":["401K"],"points":[{"start":7522,"end":7527,"text":"401(k)"}]},{"label":["Stock_options"],"points":[{"start":5608,"end":5646,"text":"eceive 7,000 shares of restricted stock"}]},{"label":["Bonus"],"points":[{"start":3696,"end":3802,"text":"25% of annual base salary and a maximum of 50% of base salary will be contributed to your LTI bonus account"}]},{"label":["Bonus"],"points":[{"start":3602,"end":3626,"text":"long term incentive bonus"}]},{"label":["Base_Salary"],"points":[{"start":3496,"end":3525,"text":"annual base salary of $430,000"}]},{"label":["Start_date"],"points":[{"start":2749,"end":2778,"text":"on or before September 1, 2005"}]},{"label":["Bonus"],"points":[{"start":1857,"end":1914,"text":"incentive bonus targeted at 50% of your annual base salary"}]},{"label":["Bonus"],"points":[{"start":1536,"end":1572,"text":"up to 40% of your annual target bonus"}]},{"label":["Bonus"],"points":[{"start":1196,"end":1224,"text":"sign-on cash bonus of $50,000"}]},{"label":["Base_Salary"],"points":[{"start":1034,"end":1056,"text":"annual rate of $430,000"}]},{"label":["Start_date"],"points":[{"start":919,"end":948,"text":"on or before September 1, 2005"}]},{"label":["Supervisor_Info"],"points":[{"start":502,"end":597,"text":"shall perform such other services and duties as the CEO or Board may from time to time designate"}]},{"label":["Role"],"points":[{"start":401,"end":429,"text":"Senior Vice President-Finance"}]},{"label":["Name_employer"],"points":[{"start":200,"end":230,"text":"American Eagle Outfitters, Inc."}]},{"label":["Role"],"points":[{"start":166,"end":194,"text":"Senior Vice President-Finance"}]},{"label":["Name_employee"],"points":[{"start":85,"end":95,"text":"Joan Hilson"}]},{"label":["Date_aggrement"],"points":[{"start":57,"end":69,"text":"July 18, 2005"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1553649462000,"last_updated_at":1553649462000,"sec_taken":0,"last_updated_by":"izZDlcm2gHZ86p8XKDKOMo9hqZT2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

Where capitalized terms are used in this letter, they have the meanings ascribed to them in my Employment Agreement.\n\nEffective immediately, I relinquish my right under any and all circumstances to be paid any portion of the Gross-Up Payment.\n\nEffective immediately, I relinquish my right under any and all circumstances to be paid the cash severance amount calculated under clause\n(x) of Section 8(c)(i) of my Employment Agreement. Accordingly, the amount of cash severance payment to which I may become entitled pursuant to Section 8(c) of my Employment Agreement, which governs the calculation of my cash\nseverance payment if there is a qualifying termination of my employment in connection with a Change in Control, will be calculated solely by reference to Sections 8(b)(i)(A) and (B) of my Employment Agreement. All of the other provisions of\nSection 8(c), governing, for example, the circumstances triggering the payment of severance and the time and form of the payment, will remain unchanged.\nI understand and agree that this letter will be publicly disclosed and filed, as required by law. I acknowledge the receipt of good and valuable consideration for my relinquishment of the rights set forth\nabove. I further acknowledge that said consideration does not include any collateral agreements, promises, or representations by McKesson regarding my relinquishment of these rights under my Employment Agreement, the effect of my doing so, or any\naspect of my continuing employment with McKesson.\nI waive for all time the right, if any, to (i) claim that McKesson has\nbreached my Employment Agreement or (ii) claim Good Reason for the termination of my employment under my Employment Agreement, in any case, based solely on my having executed and delivered this letter or the terms that are contained in it, or\nbased on McKesson’s having accepted and agreed to the terms of this letter. I also agree that nothing in this letter is to be construed as an admission by McKesson that McKesson’s acceptance of this letter constitutes a breach of my\nEmployment Agreement or Good Reason for the termination of my employment under my Employment Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI fully understand the terms of this letter and I have consulted with my own attorney during\nthe preparation of this letter.

No oral waiver, amendment or modification will be effective under any circumstances whatsoever.\n19. Severability.

If a\ndeemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such arbitrator or court, the unenforceable provision shall be deemed deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby.\n20. Waiver. Either party’s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such\nprovision, or prevent that party thereafter from enforcing that provision and each and every other provision of this Agreement.\n21.\nIndemnification. Employer agrees to provide Employee with a defense and indemnification in accordance with the provisions of the California Labor Code against any third party claims related to or arising out of Employee’s employment with\nor positions held for Employer; provided,\n\n\n\n\n\n6\t  \t Initials: Employer              Employee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhowever, that Employer shall not be liable, and shall not provide a defense or indemnification for any claim wherein the Employee has acted outside\nthe course and scope of his/her employment.\n22. Arbitration.\na. Agreement to Arbitrate. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Employee and Employer agree to arbitrate any controversy, claim\nor dispute between them arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement, the employment relationship between Employer and Employee and any disputes upon termination of employment, including but not limited to breach of contract, tort,\ndiscrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, demotion, discipline, failure to accommodate, family and medical leave, compensation or benefits claims, intellectual property claims, constitutional claims; and any claims for violation of any\nlocal, state or federal law, statute, regulation or ordinance or common law. For the purpose of this agreement to arbitrate, references to “Employer” include all parent, subsidiary or related entities and their employees, supervisors,\nofficers, directors, agents, pension or benefit plans, pension or benefit plan sponsors, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates and all successors and assigns of any of them, and this agreement shall apply to them to the extent Employee’s\nclaims arise out of or relate to their actions on behalf of Employer. By executing this Agreement, Employee and the Employer are both waiving the right to a jury trial with respect to any such disputes.\nb. Consideration. The mutual promise by Employer and Employee to arbitrate any and all disputes between them rather than litigate\nthem before the courts or other bodies, provides the consideration for this agreement to arbitrate.\nc. Initiation of\nArbitration. Either party may exercise the right to arbitrate by providing the other party with written notice of any and all claims forming the basis of such right in sufficient detail to inform the other party of the substance of such claims.\nIn no event shall the request for arbitration be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claims would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. All issues of arbitrability shall be governed by\nthe Federal Arbitration Act.\nd. Arbitration Procedure.

The parties are entitled to representation by an attorney or other representative of their choosing. The arbitrator shall have the power to enter any award that could be entered by a judge of the trial court of the State of\nCalifornia, and only such power, and shall follow the law. The parties agree to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall issue the award in writing and therein state the essential findings and conclusions on\nwhich the award is based. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Employer shall bear the costs of the arbitration filing and hearing fees and the fees of\nthe arbitrator.\n23. Attorneys’ Fees.

This Agreement has been drafted by legal counsel representing Employer, but Employee has participated in the negotiation of its terms.\nFurthermore, Employee acknowledges that Employee has had an opportunity to review and revise the Agreement and has had it reviewed by legal counsel, if desired, and, therefore, the rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be\nresolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n7\t  \t Initials: Employer              Employee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25. Employee Acknowledgment. Employee acknowledges that he/she has been advised by Employer to\nconsult with independent counsel of his/her own choice, at his/her expense, concerning this Agreement, that he/she has had the opportunity to do so, and that he/she has taken advantage of that opportunity to the extent that he/she desires. Employee\nfurther acknowledges that he/she has read and understands this Agreement, is fully aware of its legal effect, and has entered into it freely based on his/her own judgment.\n26.

however, it will be given effect as though it were executed and entered into on March 19, 2012.  You will report to me, in my capacity as Interim Chief Executive Officer, until such time as WMI’s Board of Directors determines an alternative reporting relationship.  This letter agreement (the “Agreement”) outlines the terms and conditions of your employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will have the title of Senior Vice President & Director of Finance and will be responsible to perform all of the duties customarily associated with that position or as otherwise directed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWMI agrees to employ you, and you are accepting such employment, on an “at will” basis;
