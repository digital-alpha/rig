Hi,

I'd like to introduce myself and explain why I think I am good fit for your job.

I’m a senior software engineer with 7+ years experience working professionally; I’m well known for my work with & on Node.js and React.js.

I enjoy working on projects where I can have full-stack autonomy.

I have recently worked a lot with performance analysis, multiple databases (postgresql, mongodb, etc), GraphQL (an alternative to REST APIs which speeds up product development and stability), and service based architectures (generally partitioned at data/product verticals), rather than micro services.
