Confidentiality; Non-Compete; Non-Disclosure; Non-Disparagement.</br>(a) The Executive hereby agrees that, during the</br>Employment Period and thereafter, he will hold in strict confidence any proprietary or Confidential Information related to Aleris, the Company and its affiliates. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information”</br>shall mean all information of Aleris, the Company or any of its affiliates (in whatever form) which is not generally known to the public, including without limitation any inventions, processes, methods of distribution, customer lists or</br>customers’ or trade secrets.</br>(b) The Executive and the Company agree that Aleris, the Company and its affiliates would likely suffer</br>significant harm from the Executive’s competing with Aleris, the Company or its affiliates during the Employment Period and for some period of time thereafter. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that he will not, during the Employment Period and</br>for a period of twelve months following the termination of the Employment Period, directly or indirectly, become employed by, engage in business with, serve as an agent or consultant to, become a partner, member, principal, stockholder or other</br>owner (other than a holder of less than 1% of the outstanding voting shares of any publicly held company) of, any Person competitive with, or otherwise perform services relating to, the business of Aleris, the Company or its affiliates at the time</br>of the termination for any Person (the “Business”) (whether or not for compensation). For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Person” shall mean any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company,</br>unincorporated organization, trust or joint venture, or a governmental agency or political subdivision thereof that is engaged in the Business, or otherwise competes with Aleris, the Company or its affiliates, anywhere in which Aleris, the Company</br>or its affiliates engage in or intend to engage in the Business or where Aleris, the Company or its affiliates’ customers are located.</br>(c) The Executive hereby agrees that, upon the termination of the Employment Period, he shall not take, without the prior written consent of the Company, any drawing, blueprint, specification or other document (in whatever form) of the</br>Company or its affiliates, which is of a confidential nature relating to Aleris, the Company or its affiliates, or, without limitation, relating to its or their methods of distribution, or any description of any formulas or secret processes and will</br>return any such information (in whatever form) then in his possession.</br>(d) The Executive hereby agrees not to defame or disparage Aleris,</br>the Company, its affiliates and their officers, directors, members or executives. The Executive hereby agrees to cooperate with Aleris, the Company and its affiliates in refuting any defamatory or disparaging remarks by any third party made in</br>respect of Aleris, the Company or its affiliates or their directors, members, officers or executives.</br></br></br>7</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>9. Injunctive Relief.</br>It is impossible to measure in money the damages that will accrue to Aleris, the Company or its affiliates in the event that the Executive breaches any of</br>the restrictive covenants provided in Sections 7 and 8 hereof. In the event that the Executive breaches any such restrictive covenant, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction restraining the Executive from violating such restrictive covenant</br>(without posting any bond). If the Company shall institute any action or proceeding to enforce any such restrictive covenant, the Executive hereby waives the claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law and agrees not to assert in</br>any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law. The foregoing shall not prejudice the Company’s right to require the Executive to account for and pay over to the Company, and the Executive</br>hereby agrees to account for and pay over, the compensation, profits, monies, accruals or other benefits derived or received by the Executive as a result of any transaction constituting a breach of any of the restrictive covenants provided in</br>Sections 7 and 8 hereof.</br>10.

Furthermore, unless</br>prohibited by law, Executive will make available to the Company all inventions made within two years after the termination of his employment if such inventions stem from with his services for the Company or are significantly based on the</br>Company’s know-how or operations.</br>11.

Likewise he empowers</br>the Company to forward all relevant personal data of his which relate to this employment agreement to Aleris and its affiliates.

</br>or to such other address as any party hereto may designate by notice to the others.</br>(b) This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the Executive’s employment hereunder, and</br>supersedes and is in full substitution for any and all prior understandings or agreements with respect to the Executive’s employment (it being understood that any Options and Shares shall be governed by the relevant Equity Agreements). The</br>Executive’s employment with the Company for purposes of this Agreement shall include the Executive’s employment by any direct or indirect subsidiary of Aleris or the Company.</br></br></br>9</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>(c) This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto, and any</br>provision hereof may be waived only by an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties against whom or which enforcement of such waiver is sought. The failure of any party hereto at any time to require the performance by any other party</br>hereto of any provision hereof shall in no way affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of any succeeding</br>breach of such provision or a waiver of the provision itself or a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement.</br>(d) The parties hereto</br>acknowledge and agree that each party has reviewed and negotiated the terms and provisions of this Agreement and has had the opportunity to contribute to its revision. Accordingly, the rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are resolved</br>against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement. Rather, the terms of this Agreement shall be construed fairly as to both parties hereto and not in favor or against either party.</br>(e) (i) This Agreement is binding on and is for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors,</br>administrators and other legal representatives. Neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation hereunder may be assigned by the Executive.</br>(ii) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Aleris or the Company to assume this Agreement in the</br>same manner and to the same extent that the Company would have been required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in the Agreement, “the Company” shall mean both the Company as defined above and any such successor</br>that assumes this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise.</br>(f) Any provision of this Agreement (or portion thereof) which is deemed</br>invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction and subject to this Section, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions</br>thereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provisions of this Agreement invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. If any covenant should be deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable because its scope is considered</br>excessive, such covenant shall be modified so that the scope of the covenant is reduced only to the minimum extent necessary to render the modified covenant valid, legal and enforceable. No waiver of any provision or violation of this Agreement by</br>the Company shall be implied by the Company’s forbearance or failure to take action.</br>(g) The Company may withhold from any amounts</br>payable to the Executive hereunder all taxes that the Company may reasonably determine are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation, (it being understood, that the Executive shall be responsible for payment of all taxes</br>in respect of the payments and benefits provided herein).</br></br></br>10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>(h) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland without</br>reference to its principles of conflicts of law. Any and all disputes in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in Zurich, conducted under the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration of the Swiss Chambers of Commerce</br>by one arbitrator who shall be a senior lawyer of one of the pre-eminent law firms in the Zurich area and who shall be appointed by the chairman of the Zurich Chamber of Commerce. The proceedings shall be conducted in English and all awards shall be</br>rendered in English.</br>(i) This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of</br>which shall constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile of a signature shall be deemed to be and have the effect of an original signature.</br>(j) The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be a part of or control or affect the meaning of any provision hereof.</br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.</br></br></br></br>EXECUTIVE</br></br>/s/
