The failure of any party hereto at any time to require the performance by any other party\nhereto of any provision hereof shall in no way affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of any succeeding\nbreach of such provision or a waiver of the provision itself or a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement.\n(d) The parties hereto\nacknowledge and agree that each party has reviewed and negotiated the terms and provisions of this Agreement and has had the opportunity to contribute to its revision.

Gast, MD, PhD\n111 Augusta Drive\nWest Chester, PA 19382\nDear Michael:\nI am pleased to offer you\nthe position of Senior Vice President, Clinical Research and Development with Genaera Corporation, reporting to John L. Armstrong, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. Your base salary will be $25,000.00 per month ($300,000/year). Bonuses are\nawarded to officers at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. In the event a Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is hired, it is anticipated that you will report to the CMO at that time.\nContingent upon your acceptance of this offer, it is expected that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will grant to you at its next meeting options to\npurchase 100,000 shares of Genaera Common Stock, and a grant of 50,000 shares of restricted stock. The exercise price of your stock options will be set at the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the later of the date of the Board of\nDirectors grants the options (typically its next meeting) or your start date. These stock options will have a term of 10 years and vest at the rate of 33.33% per year. The restricted stock will vest at the rate of 25% every six months over two\nyears. As with all Genaera options, the grant will be subject to execution of a stock option agreement in the form specified by the Compensation Committee.\nIf Genaera terminates your employment without cause (“cause” is defined in Genaera’s 2004 Stock Based Incentive Compensation Plan, referred to as the “Plan”) after you are employed, you will receive your monthly\nbase salary for (12) twelve months following your termination date or until you secure full time employment elsewhere, whichever period is shorter. “Cause” pursuant to subsection (iv) of Section 2.4 of the Plan relating to\nbreach of an employment or consulting agreement shall be interpreted to constitute cause for purposes of this letter agreement only if the breach remains uncured after reasonable written notice to you of the breach or if the breach by its nature is\nnot curable, then no cure period shall be required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Gast\nPage 2\nIn the event your employment is\ninvoluntarily terminated as a result of a Change in Control of the Company, you will be eligible to receive severance payments as approved by the Genaera Board of Directors provided under separate cover.\nAs conditions of receiving any severance benefits from Genaera, you must: (a) not be in breach of any agreement executed with Genaera as part of your employment,\nincluding, the Company’s Proprietary Information Agreement (includes Non-Solicitation Clause), Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, Statement on Insider Information and Insider Trading, Conflict of Interest Policy, Sexual Harassment\nPolicy and the Drug Free Workplace Policy; and (b) sign a general release, including a non-disparagement clause, in a form acceptable to Genaera.\nUpon the commencement of your employment with the Company, you will be expected to execute the Company’s Drug-Free Workplace Policy, Proprietary Information Agreement, Policy Statement on Insider Information and Insider Trading, Sexual\nHarassment Policy, and Conflicts of Interest Policy, each in the form provided in this packet. Genaera may have already provided you with certain of its confidential business or scientific information, which it expects you to keep confidential, and\nto use only to further Genaera’s legitimate business interests. Just as Genaera expects you to keep confidential its business or scientific information, Genaera also expects you to honor your obligations to your former employers with respect to\nmaintaining the confidentiality of their business or scientific information. You have disclosed to Genaera that Wyeth has asked you to write several scientific papers and attend certain meetings. You also mentioned that communications related to\ncompletion of these matters may continue on an occasional basis thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, Genaera acknowledges that these activities do not constitute a conflict of interest for purposes of Genaera’s policies and do not constitute\nan inappropriate relationship with a competitor under Genaera’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nYou will be eligible for twenty-five\n(25) vacation days per year starting in 2006. Vacation accrues proportionate to months employed. Employees are encouraged to take their vacations yearly.

The employment relationship between EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYER is completely and, in all respects, at-will. Either EMPLOYEE or EMPLOYER has the absolute right to\nterminate the employment relationship, at any time, with or without cause, for any reason or no reason and no reason need be given. The fact that other sections of this Agreement provide differential post-termination benefits to EMPLOYEE on the\nbasis of whether EMPLOYEE is termination With Cause or Without Cause, as defined, below, does not undermine the at-will nature of the employment relationship. This is the entire agreement between EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYER regarding the matters set forth\nin this paragraph.\n\n4. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT BY EMPLOYER\n\n\nTermination For Cause. For\npurposes of this Agreement, Termination for Cause shall mean the existence of or a belief by the EMPLOYER in the existence of facts which constitute a basis for termination of employee’s employment in view of relevant factors and circumstances,\nwhich may include, but are not limited to, EMPLOYEE’S duties, responsibilities, conduct on the job or otherwise, job performance, and employment record.

TREATMENT OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT BY EMPLOYER FOR CAUSE OR BY\nEMPLOYEE WITHOUT GOOD REASON.\n\nSalary\nContinuation. EMPLOYEE is not entitled to any continuation of salary or other base pay if EMPLOYEE is either terminated by EMPLOYER for Cause or if EMPLOYEE resigns his/her employment.\n\nIncentive Pay. EMPLOYEE is not entitled to Incentive\nPay if EMPLOYEE is either terminated by EMPLOYER for Cause or if EMPLOYEE resigns his/her employment.\n\nHealth Benefits. EMPLOYEE is entitled to continue Health Benefits coverage pursuant to the terms of COBRA if EMPLOYEE is either\nterminated by EMPLOYER for Cause or if EMPLOYEE resigns his/her employment.\n\nStock Options and Restricted Stock. The vesting period ceases immediately upon EMPLOYEE’s termination by EMPLOYER for Cause or if EMPLOYEE resigns his/her employment. The provisions of the Stock Option\nAgreement will otherwise be controlling.\n\n7. TREATMENT OF\nCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT BY EMPLOYER AFTER CHANGE IN CONTROL OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, OR BY EMPLOYEE FOR GOOD REASON.\n\nIf the EMPLOYEE’S employment shall be terminated after a Change in Control as defined by Section 10, (a) by the Company other than for Cause, or (b)\nby the EMPLOYEE for Good Reason, the EMPLOYEE shall be entitled to the following benefits:\n\nSeverance Payment. EMPLOYEE shall be paid an amount equal to two times the Executive’s combined current year Base Salary and\nactual Bonus compensation for the preceding fiscal year; provided, however, the severance amount shall not be less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) nor more (once the minimum is reached, than one percent (1.0%) of the book value of\nthe Company (i.e., the amount reported on the Company’s balance sheet prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as stockholder’s equity). The Severance Payment shall be payable fifty percent (50%) within five (5)\ndays after the termination date and the remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be payable in twelve (12) equal consecutive monthly installments beginning on the first day of the month following the termination date.\n\nHealth Benefits. EMPLOYEE is entitled to continue\nHealth Benefits coverage pursuant to the terms of COBRA if EMPLOYEE is either terminated by EMPLOYER after a Change in Control or if EMPLOYEE terminates employment with Good Reason.\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Options and Restricted Stock. Vesting will accelerate to the date of\ntermination. In other words, after a Change in Control, if EMPLOYEE is either terminated by EMPLOYER, other than for Cause, or if EMPLOYEE terminates employment with Good Reason, EMPLOYEE shall immediately be vested with all stock options and\nrestricted stock awarded by the Company which have not been exercised prior to the termination date. The provisions of the Stock Option Agreement will otherwise be controlling.\n\n8. TREATMENT OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION BY EMPLOYER FOR DEATH OR DISABILITY.\n\nSalary Continuation. EMPLOYEE is not entitled to any\ncontinuation of salary or other base pay if EMPLOYEE is terminated by EMPLOYER due to EMPLOYEE’s death or disability.\n\nIncentive Pay. EMPLOYEE is not entitled to Incentive Pay if EMPLOYEE is terminated by EMPLOYER due to EMPLOYEE’s death or\ndisability.\n\nHealth Benefits. EMPLOYEE\n(or EMPLOYEE’S family) is entitled to continue Health Benefits coverage pursuant to the terms of COBRA if EMPLOYEE is terminated by EMPLOYER due to death or disability.\n\nStock Options and Restricted Stock. The vesting period continues without acceleration upon\nEMPLOYEE’s termination by EMPLOYER due to disability. All stock options and restricted stock shall immediately and completely vest upon EMPLOYEE’s termination due to death. The provisions of the Stock Option Agreement will otherwise be\ncontrolling.\n\n9. TREATMENT OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS UPON\nTERMINATION BY EMPLOYER WITHOUT CAUSE OR BY EMPLOYEE FOR GOOD REASON.\n\nConsultancy Agreement. In the event EMPLOYEE is terminated without Cause or by EMPLOYEE for GOOD REASON, EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYER shall immediately enter into an independent contractor/consultant agreement\npursuant to which EMPLOYEE shall receive pay in an amount equal to twelve (12) months base salary only (hereinafter “Consultancy Pay”) in exchange for consulting services. The term of the consultancy will be for 12 months after the date of\nEMPLOYEE’s termination (“Consulting Period”). EMPLOYEE agrees to make himself or herself available to EMPLOYER for up to ten (10) hours per week, whether by telephone, e-mail, or in person, on an as-needed basis to consult with\nrespect to matters that were within EMPLOYEE’s job description during the course of EMPLOYEE’s employment. EMPLOYEE agrees to respond promptly, reasonably and cooperatively to EMPLOYER’s requests for assistance. Barring special\ncircumstances, the consulting\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhours shall not be cumulative; accordingly, hours not used within a given week will be waived by the\nEMPLOYER, but EMPLOYEE will receive his or her full pay under this paragraph. However, EMPLOYER reserves the right to require EMPLOYEE to provide more than ten (10) hours of service per week in the event that special circumstances arise in which\nEMPLOYEE’s unique assistance is required by EMPLOYER. (Examples of special circumstances include, but are not limited to assistance in litigation or responding to government inquiries). In order to protect EMPLOYER’s confidential and trade\nsecret information from use or disclosure to a party other than the EMPLOYER, and to enable the Company to be able to obtain the benefits of EMPLOYEE’s consulting obligations hereunder, EMPLOYEE agrees that so long as he is accepting\nConsultancy Pay pursuant to this section, he (a) will not accept employment or consulting work in any capacity with any competitor of EMPLOYER; and (b) will continue to abide by the provisions of paragraphs 8, and 9, below. In the event that\nEMPLOYEE accepts subsequent employment or other consulting work within the Consulting Period, EMPLOYEE will be required to spend no more than five (5) hours per week consulting with EMPLOYER. EMPLOYEE understands that this is a material term of this\nAgreement.\n\nIncentive Pay. In the event\nEMPLOYEE is terminated without Cause, EMPLOYEE, at EMPLOYER’S discretion, shall be entitled to Incentive Pay in an amount equal to the pro-rata portion of incentive pay for the period of employment beginning January 1st of the year in which the termination occurs and ending the date of termination. The full amount, at EMPLOYER’S\ndiscretion, of pro-rated Incentive Pay will be paid to EMPLOYEE in one lump sum payment made within thirty (30) days after the EMPLOYEE’S termination date.\n\nHealth Benefits. EMPLOYEE is entitled to continue Health Benefits coverage pursuant to the terms of\nCOBRA if EMPLOYEE is terminated by EMPLOYER without cause.\n\nStock Options and Restricted Stock. The vesting period for the year in which the termination occurs will accelerate to the date of termination. In other words, upon termination without cause, EMPLOYEE shall\nimmediately be vested with all stock options and restricted that would have been vested at the end of he year in which the termination occurred. All other vesting ceases upon termination. The provisions of the Stock Option Agreement will otherwise\nbe controlling.\n\n10. CHANGE IN CONTROL. A “Change\nin Control” shall be deemed to have occurred if the conditions set forth in any one of the following paragraphs shall have been satisfied.\n\n\n(a)\tAny “person” as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) (other than the Company; any trustee or\nother fiduciary holding securities under an Executive benefit plan of the Company; or any company owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the stock of the\nCompany), is\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined by Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly\nor indirectly, of the securities of the Company (not including securities beneficially owned by such person, any securities acquired directly from the Company or from a transferor in a transaction expressly approved or consented to by the Board of\nDirectors) representing more than 25% of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities; or\n\n\n(b)\tDuring any period of two consecutive years (not including any period prior to the execution of the Agreement), individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board\nof Directors and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in clause (a), (c) or (d) of this section), (i) whose election by the Board of\nDirectors or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for\nelection was previously so approved or (ii) whose election is to replace a person who ceases to be a director due to death, disability or age, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; or\n\n\n\n(c)\tThe shareholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation, other than (i) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting\nsecurities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity), in combination with the ownership of any trustee or other\nfiduciary holding securities under an Executive benefit plan of the Company, at least 75% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or\n(ii) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no person acquires more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities; or\n\n\n\n\n(d)\tThe shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all the\nCompany’s assets.\n\n\n11. NON-COMPETITION\nPROVISION\n\nDuring Employment. EMPLOYEE agrees that\nduring his/her employment by EMPLOYER he/she will not engage directly or indirectly in any location within the United States, in any business of the same or similar nature to the business of EMPLOYER or any business in which EMPLOYER is engaged in\ndeveloping, nor will\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE participate directly or indirectly in the ownership or management of any enterprise engaged in\nsuch a business within the United States, including ownership or management as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This provision acts in concert with Section 1, Employment by Company, which requires EMPLOYEE to devote all of EMPLOYEE’S\neffort and skill exclusively to EMPLOYER.\n\nUpon\nTermination of Employment. EMPLOYEE agrees that he/she will not seek or accept employment with any business in direct competition with EMPLOYER for a period of one year after termination of the employment relationship, anywhere in the United\nStates. EMPLOYEE further agrees that for a period of one year, he/she will neither contact nor solicit business from any employee, customer or independent contractor, past, present or future, of the EMPLOYER.\n\n12. NON-INTERFERENCE AND NON-SOLICITATION PROVISION\n\nEMPLOYEE agrees that during the term of his/her employment\nwith EMPLOYER and for a period of one (1) year after termination of employment with EMPLOYER for any reason: (1) EMPLOYEE shall not either directly or directly interfere with the business of EMPLOYER or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; and (2)\nEMPLOYEE shall not directly or indirectly solicit any of EMPLOYER’S employees to leave EMPLOYER and/or to work for another employer or business, whether or not the solicited employee would commit any breach of his or her own employment terms by\nleaving the service of the EMPLOYER. Thus, EMPLOYEE agrees that he/she will not either directly or indirectly initiate any communications or direct others to initiate any communications with EMPLOYER’S employees regarding the possibility of\nemployment elsewhere during the term of this non-solicitation provision.\n\n13.

EMPLOYEE hereby agrees and understands that all loans, loan files, loan documentation, client lists and potential client lists are the possession\nand property of EMPLOYER.

In addition, upon termination,\nEMPLOYEE shall leave in possession of EMPLOYER all equipment, furniture and supplies owned or leased by EMPLOYER.\n\n\nEMPLOYEE recognizes and acknowledges that none of the above provisions or EMPLOYER”S exercise of any rights thereunder shall limit\nthe rights of EMPLOYER under applicable statutes and common law rules regarding trade secrets, including, without limitation, the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. ASSIGNMENT: SUCCESSORS\n\nThe rights, which accrue to the EMPLOYER under this Agreement, shall pass to its successors and assigns.\nEMPLOYEE may not assign any right under this Agreement with respect to the employment relationship, commencement, and termination of the employment relationship.\n\n15.

{"content": "Exhibit 10.1\n\n\n\nFebruary 16, 1998\n\nMr. John A. Shaw\n2410 White Horse Road\nBerwyn,  PA   19312\n\nDear John:\n\nIt is with great  pleasure  that we welcome  you to Virginia  Power.  As we have\ndiscussed,  your  employment  will begin March 16,  1998,  based on the Board of\nDirectors  electing you as an officer on February  20, 1998.  Your title will be\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Virginia Power.\n\nThe terms of your employment agreement are as follows:\n\nDuties\n\nBoth  you and the  Company  agree  that you  will  serve in a senior  management\nposition.  You agree to (i) devote your  knowledge,  skill and best efforts on a\nfull-time  basis to performing  your duties and obligations to the Company (with\nthe  exceptions  of absences on the account of illness or vacation in accordance\nwith the Company's policies and civic and charitable commitments not involving a\nconflict with the Company's  business),  and (ii) comply with the lawful and non\narbitrary  directions  and orders of the Board of Directors and Chief  executive\nOfficer of the Company with respect to the performance of your duties.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECT COMPENSATION\n\nYour total direct  compensation will consist of three  components:  base salary,\nannual incentive, and long-term incentive.\n\nBase Salary\n\nYour initial base salary will be $240,000,  paid monthly on or about the 25th of\nthe month. Each fall,  officer's  salaries are normally reviewed by the Virginia\nPower Board of Directors and any changes will take effect on the following March\n1. You will  participate  in the base  salary  program  on the same terms as all\nother elected officers.\n\n\n\n< PAGE>\n\nMr. Shaw\nPage 2\n\n\nAnnual Incentive\n\nYour  annualized  incentive  target for 1998 is $114,100 and is based on meeting\ncorporate  and business  goals for the calendar  year 1998.  For 1998,  you will\nreceive a pro-rata  award of  one-twelfth  for every  full  month of  employment\nduring 1998, or a target of $85,575. Annual incentive awards are approved by the\nBoard and are paid during the first quarter of the following year (e.g.,  awards\nfor 1998  will be paid in the first  quarter  of 1999).  The Board  reviews  the\nprogram each  February,  and approves the current year targets at that time. You\nwill participate in the annual incentive  program on the same terms as all other\nelected officers.\n\nLong - Term Incentive\n\nEvery year we begin a new three-year plan cycle. For each partial cycle in which\nyou  participate  you will receive a pro rata  distribution  from the plan.  For\nexample,  when you complete the 1998 - 2000 three-year  cycle,  you will receive\n33/36 of the final award  distribution  (representing  your  participation  from\nApril 1, 1998 through  December 31, 2000).  Your 100% target for the 1998 - 2000\ncycle is $157,000,  which will be prorated to $143,917.  Shares of stock will be\nissued at the completion of the cycle based on the then-current  value per share\nand in compliance  with the guidelines of the long-term  plan.  These plans will\ncontinue  at the  discretion  of the  Virginia  Power Board of  Directors.  Your\nparticipation  in the long-term  incentive plan will be on the same terms as all\nother elected officers.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE INDIRECT COMPENSATION\n\nQualified Pension Plan\n\nAs stated in your offer  letter,  you will be credited  with 20 years of service\nupon attaining age 55 and 30 years of service at age 60.\n\nExecutive Supplement Retirement Plan (ESRP)\n\nOfficers  who  retire  with a  minimum  of five  years of  service  as a company\nemployee receive additional payments for 10 years. The annual benefit is payable\non a  monthly  basis  and is equal to 25% of final  annual  compensation.  Final\nannual compensation is defined as the base salary at the time of retirement plus\na  percentage  (currently  95%) of the annual  incentive  target.  The plan also\nprovides for payments to begin if you die or become disabled before  retirement.\nIf you die after  retirement,  but before receiving ten years of benefits,  your\nbeneficiary will receive the remaining payments. At retirement, you may elect to\nreceive an actuarially  reduced payment for up to 16 years.  There is a\n\n\n< PAGE>\n\nMr. Shaw\nPage 3\n\nseparate calculation for participants having a minimum of five years service but\nretiring before age 55.\n\nExecutive Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan\n\nSince the company  sets base  salaries  below  market,  and since the  qualified\npension is based on actual base  salaries,  executive  pensions  are  calculated\nusing an \"adjusted  base salary for pension  purposes.\"  The  increased  pension\nbenefit cannot,  by law, be paid out of the qualified  pension plan. The Benefit\nRestoration  Plan makes up for the portion of the pension  which  cannot be paid\nfrom the qualified plan.  Federal law also limits the qualified pension coverage\nto the first $160,000 of base salary.  The restoration plan is also used to make\nup for base salary which exceeds the $160,000 cap.\n\nRabbi Trust\n\nFrom time to time, the company makes discretionary  payments into a Rabbi Trust.\nThis account is used to fund the payment of benefits payable under the Executive\nSupplemental Retirement Plan and/or the Executive Retirement Benefit Restoration\nPlan. The funds in the trust can only be used for the executive's  benefit,  and\ncannot revert to the company  under any  circumstances.  Benefits  funded in the\nRabbi Trust are subject to claims of the company's creditors.  The amount of the\ncompany's  contribution  to the trust fund is not taxable to the executive until\nactual payments are made to the executive from the trust.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE PERQUISITES\n\nExecutive Continuity Agreement\n\nThis  \"Golden  Parachute\"  provides  three  years of  protection  for salary and\nincentives in case of a hostile takeover.\n\nCompany Car and Phone\n\nA company car, with cellular phone,  is furnished.  The value of personal use is\nreported as taxable income.\n\nExecutive Accidental Death and Dismemberment\n\nAll executives and spouses are provided  $200,000  coverage for business  travel\naboard  company  aircraft.  However,  as a senior  executive,  you are  provided\n$200,000 coverage for all accidents.  Your spouse receives all accident coverage\nat the lesser rate of $150,000.  These  benefit  amounts are payable for loss of\nlife,  hands,  feet or eyes.  Half the  benefit is payable for loss of one hand,\nfoot, or eye. Coverage ends at age 70.\n\n\n< PAGE>\n\nMr. Shaw\nPage 4\n\nExecutive Deferred Compensation\n\nExecutives may elect to defer part or all of base salary and/or annual incentive\nawards. The election must take place before the period in which the compensation\nis earned. Deferred compensation is subject to Social Security and Medicare tax,\nbut  federal  and state  income  taxes  are  deferred.  No funds or  assets  are\nspecifically set aside for the deferred amount. Deferred compensation is carried\nas a  liability  on the  company  books and the  executive  has the status of an\nunsecured creditor of the company. The deferred amount accumulates \"earnings\" as\nif it were invested in the executive's  choice of an interest bearing account or\nDominion Resources, Inc. Common Stock.\n\nExecutive Physical Examinations\n\nEmployee Health Services schedules executives for annual physical examinations.\n\nExecutive Estate and Tax Planning\n\nThe company pays for an initial  educational  consultation with a local attorney\n(Louis Mezzullo)  specializing in estate planning.  Subsequently,  the executive\nmay choose Mr. Mezzullo or any qualified  professional to aid in the development\nof an initial  estate plan.  The company will  reimburse up to $1,000 toward the\ninitial  estate plan,  and $500 per year,  thereafter,  for an annual review and\nupdate. These taxable reimbursements are paid through payroll.\n\n\nSTANDARD BENEFITS\n\nHealth:  Medical, Drugs, Dental & Vision\n\nEmployees may choose among three deductible/co-pay  options for medical coverage\n(Blue Cross/Blue Shield Preferred  Provider Plan) or one of several HMOs. Dental\nand vision  coverage is available.  All are subsidized and may include  eligible\ndependents.\n\nGroup Life Insurance\n\nUp to three times annual salary coverage is available on a subsidized  basis. An\nadditional  two times  annual  salary is available  on a  non-subsidized  basis.\n$10,000 coverage is available for a spouse; $4,000 for children.\n\nAccidental Death and Dismemberment\n\nUp to three times base salary (as  selected  for group  life) is  available  for\nemployees at no extra charge.\n\n\n\n< PAGE>\n\nMr. Shaw\nPage 5\n\n\nLong-Term Disability\n\nSubsidized  coverage of 60% or 65% of salary is available  after  eligibility is\nestablished. There is a maximum benefit of $10,000 per month.\n\nQualified Pension Plan\n\nAt age 65, the normal  benefit for 30 years of service is  approximately  60% of\nyour final five years average salary, subject to a Social Security offset. It is\nnon-contributory.  Your coverage under  Virginia  Power's  Retirement  Plan will\nbegin after six (6) months of employment.\n\n401(k) Plan and Savings Plan\n\nBoth pre- and post-tax  options are  available.  The company  matches 50% on the\nfirst 6% of salary contributed by the employee, limited to the first $160,000 of\nsalary.\n\nWe believe that this is an excellent  opportunity  for Virginia Power to benefit\nfrom your skills and background, and we look forward to you joining our team.\n\nTo indicate your  acceptance of this offer,  please sign below and return a copy\nto me.\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nNorman Askew\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\nAcknowledged: /s/ John A.

Pursuant Agreement, Mr. Paz’s\nprevious employment agreement with the Company, entered into in April 2004 (the\n“2004 Agreement”) with Mr. Paz was terminated other than those terms addressing\nthe stock option and restricted stock grants under the 2004 Agreement, which\nterms were incorporated by reference into the Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nThe\nAgreement was effective as of April 1, 2005 with an initial term through March\n31, 2008. The Agreement provides for (i) an initial base salary of $650,000\n(which may not be reduced after any increase); (ii) a guaranteed minimum annual\nbonus target under the Company’s bonus plan of 100% of Mr. Paz’s annual base\nsalary, with a bonus opportunity for each calendar year during the employment\nperiod of up to 200% of the executive’s guaranteed minimum annual bonus in the\nevent the Company achieves certain “stretch” financial and work plan goals;\n(iii) participation in the Company’s benefit and incentive plans and other\narrangements in accordance with their terms; (iv) the crediting of a deferred\nbonus in the amount of $200,000 to the executive’s retirement account in the\nCompany’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the “EDCP”), subject to the\nterms and conditions of the EDCP, which bonus generally vests at the end of the\ninitial employment period except as described below; (v) a grant under the\nCompany’s 2000 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2000 LTIP”) of an option to\npurchase 40,000 shares of the Common Stock, vesting in three equal increments on\nMarch 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008; and (vi) such perquisites and fringe\nbenefits to which similarly situated Company executives are entitled and which\nare suitable for Mr. Paz’s position.\n\n\n\n\nIf Mr.\nPaz’s employment is terminated prior to expiration of the employment period, he\nis not entitled to receive any further payments or benefits that have not\nalready been paid or provided (including any unvested portion of the option\ngrant or restricted stock award) except as follows:\n\n\n\n\nMr.\nPaz will be entitled to all previously earned and accrued, but unpaid,\nannual base salary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf\nMr. Paz’s employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or\nDisability, or by Mr. Paz for Good Reason (as those terms are defined in\nthe Agreement), Mr. Paz is entitled to receive: (i) a pro rata portion of\nthe restricted stock award under the 2004 Agreement based on the number of\ndays worked during the employment period under the 2004 Agreement; (ii) a\nseverance benefit equal to 18 months of his base salary plus a specified\nportion of his bonus potential for the year based on the average\npercentage of the potential earned for the three prior years; (iii)\nreimbursement for the cost of continuing medical insurance for Mr. Paz,\nhis spouse and any eligible dependents for 36 months after termination of\nemployment; and (iv) a pro rata portion of the deferred bonus based on the\nnumber of days worked during the initial employment\nperiod.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf\nMr. Paz’s employment terminates on account of Disability or retirement\n(i.e., voluntary retirement on or after age 59 ½ but not within 90 days\nafter a change in control (as defined in the Agreement) of the Company)\nprior to the end of his employment period under the Agreement, Mr. Paz\ngenerally is entitled to receive (i) a certain percentage of the\nrestricted stock award calculated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,\n(ii) a pro rata portion of the deferred bonus, and (iii) reimbursement for\nthe cost of continuing medical insurance for Mr. Paz, his spouse and any\neligible dependents for 36 months after termination of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf\nMr. Paz’s employment terminates on account of death prior to the end of\nhis employment period under the Agreement, Mr. Paz’s estate generally is\nentitled to receive (i) 100% of the restricted stock award calculated\npursuant to the terms of the Agreement, (ii) 100% of the deferred bonus,\nand (iii) reimbursement for the cost of continuing medical insurance for\nMr. Paz’ spouse and any eligible dependents for 36 months after\ntermination of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Mr.\nPaz’s employment is terminated prior to expiration of the employment period\n(including any renewal period in effect) for any reason, then he is prohibited\nfrom competing against the Company for 18 months after such termination. If\ntermination of employment occurs solely as a result of expiration of the\nAgreement, Mr. Paz is prohibited from competing for one year after such\ntermination. Mr. Paz is also subject to certain non-solicitation and\nnon-disclosure limitations. Entitlement to the severance benefit described above\n(including any prorated portion) is contingent upon compliance with these\nrestrictive covenants. The parties also agreed that in the event any severance\nor similar payments to be made to Mr. Paz following termination (other than\npayments under the EDCP) should be subject to the restrictions of Section 409A\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the parties would\nnegotiate in good faith to amend the Agreement to the extent necessary to create\npayment terms with respect to such post-termination payments which are as close\nas possible to those originally set forth in the Agreement while not violating\nthe terms of Section 409A.\n\n\n\nIn the\nevent that any amount or benefit paid or distributed to Mr. Paz pursuant to the\nAgreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or\ndistributed to the executive by the Company pursuant to any other arrangement or\nplan (collectively, the “Covered Payments”), would result in the executive’s\nliability for the payment of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal\nRevenue Code (or any similar state or local tax) (collectively, the “Excise\nTax”), the Company will make a “gross-up” payment to the executive to fully\noffset the Excise Tax provided the aggregate present value of the Covered\nPayments is equal to or exceeds 125% of the maximum total payment which could be\nmade to the executive without triggering the Excise Tax. If the aggregate\npresent value of the Covered Payments, however, exceeds such maximum amount, but\nis less than 125% of such maximum amount, then the Company may, in its\ndiscretion, reduce the Covered Payments so that no portion of the Covered\nPayments is subject to the Excise Tax, and no gross-up payment will be\nmade.\n\n\n\nItem\n1.02 Termination\nof Material Definitive Agreement\n\n\n\n\nIn\nconnection with entering into the agreement with Mr. Paz described in Item 1.01\nabove, the Company and Mr. Paz terminated the 2004 Agreement entered into on\nApril 15, 2004 between the Company and Mr. Paz. A brief description of the terms\nand conditions of such employment agreement was provided in the Company’s Proxy\nStatement on Schedule 14A filed on April 16, 2004, which description is\nincorporated herein by reference.

Stock Options. For the service provided hereunder, the Company shall grant to you options to purchase\n50,000 shares of its Common Stock at an exercise price of $.35 per share (after taking into account a planned stock split associated with the above mentioned merger). Such options shall vest and become exercisable at the rate of 4,167 shares per\nmonth for the first 11 months and 4,163 shares for the twelfth month during the term of your employment and shall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Kirk Peacock\nMay\n16, 2004\nPage 2\n\n\n\ncontain such additional terms and provisions as are generally included in stock option contracts issued to other Company officers.\n\n5.

Indemnity. To the extent permitted by California law, you agree to indemnify and hold Spectral harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising\nfrom or attributable to or resulting from your gross negligence or willful misconduct in rendering the services. You warrant and represent that you have full power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and that your performance of\nthis Agreement will not violate the provisions of any other agreement to which you are a party. Spectral agrees to indemnify and hold you harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, losses, damages, liability, costs and\nexpenses, including attorneys fees arising out of your services hereunder, other than those arising from or attributable to or resulting from your gross negligence or willful misconduct. Spectral will name you as an officer on any policy of\ndirectors and officers liability insurance it secures throughout the term of your employment.\n\n7. Termination. This Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder shall, under any of the following circumstances, terminate in advance of the time specified in Section 2 above, and you shall\nhave the right to receive only your compensation that shall be accrued hereunder through the effective date of such termination and shall have no right to receive any further compensation hereunder from and after the time of such termination:\n\n\n7.1 Death. This Agreement and\nyour duties hereunder shall terminate immediately upon your death.\n\n7.2 Termination by Spectral. In the event that you shall become either physically or mentally incapacitated so as to be incapable of performing your duties as required hereunder, and if such incapacity\nshall continue for a period of 40 consecutive days, Spectral may, at its option, terminate this Agreement and your duties hereunder by written notice to you at that time or at any time thereafter while such incapacity continues. Spectral may\nterminate this Agreement for Cause (as hereinafter defined) at any time upon written notice to you. “Cause” as used in this Agreement means that you, (i) after reasonable notice and warning, have failed to perform your assigned duties\nto Spectral as determined by the Board of Directors, (ii) have materially breached any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement and have failed to correct such breach within 15 days following written notice from Spectral of such breach, or\n(iii)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Kirk Peacock\nMay\n16, 2004\nPage 3\n\n\n\nhave been charged with a felony or any intentionally fraudulent act that materially damages, or may materially damage, the business or reputation of\nSpectral.\n\n7.3 Termination by the\nCFO.
